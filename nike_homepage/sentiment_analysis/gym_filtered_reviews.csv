1,사이즈가 애매해서 2개의 사이즈를 구매했는데 조금 넉넉하게 신는 게 좋은 것 같애요! 그래도 발 건강에 좋을 것 같습니다.,1
2,추가구매 입니다. 다양한 색상 있으면 좋겠네요. 발이 편하고 이뻐서 자주 잘 신고있어요.,1
3,"불쌍한 내 발과 무릅을 위해 샀는데그냥 편하구요, 족저근막염이나 아치에 문제 있는분들에게 좋을것같아요.바운스되는 발에 운동이 되는것같구요.발걸음을잡아줘서 (뒷꿈치부터 땅에 닿게하는)운동이되서 편하면서도 힘든느낌? 너무딱딱한 신발에 길들여져 있었던것 같아요.",1
4,비싸지않은 가격에 신어도 예쁨. 골드와 그린의 조화가 좋고 아주 발이 편한데다 키높이 효과까지 있어 좋아요. 평소 신는 서이즈 주문했눈디 좋아요,1
5,런닝화 처음 신어보는데 완전 대만족입니다발에 착 붙는 느낌에다가 걷거나 뛸 때 앞으로 더 잘 나갈 수 있는 힘이 있어요완전 잘산듯..흰색 사려다가 갑자기 품절돼서 보라색으로 구매했는데 더 만족스러워요존예..얼룩이 묻어있어서 좀 그랬지만 괜차나여어차피 운동하다보면 더러워지니까,1
6,저녁으로 운동삼아 걷는데 푹신하고 좋아요발볼 발등 높은데 평소 270신어서 반업해서 275신으니 편하고 좋네요아웃솔도 내구성이 좋아서 오래신을듯해요,1
7,발이 편하고 엥긴데요 키도 커지고 검은색이라 튀지않고 모두 만족한답니다.,1
8,최근 신어본 신발 중에 제일 편합니다.사이즈는 정사이즈 신으면 됩니다,1
9,ㄴ ㅓ무나...예쁩니다. ˆ̑՝̮ˆ̑❤︎ 세상 아까워서 못신겠어요. 편한건 당연하고 가볍고 착화감이 미쳤네요. 워킹화랑 러닝화랑 고민하다가 워킹화신고 뛰어도 괜찮을것 같아구매 했습니다.실내러닝에는 문제가 없네요. 편안합니다. 블랙이랑 두가지 구매했는데 예쁜건 화이트가 진리네요.ㅎㅎ,1
10,전체적으로 만족이지만 신발에 본드같은게 묻어있어서 더러운 부분이 조금 있어서 별로 였습니다.교환할까 고민하다 신어보니 쿠션도 좋고 디자인이 맘에들어서 바로 신으려고 교환은 안했어요.,0
11,평소 웨이트 및 운동량 많은 편인데 족저근막염이 생겨서 푹신한 신발 찾다가 구매했어요. 쿠션감 좋고 걷기 편하고 높이가 좀 있습니다! 겉 부분이 천처럼 생겨서 오염 관리가 잘 될지 걱정스럽긴하지만 잘 신을게요,1
12,헬스함서 신을려고 샀는데 진짜 푹신하고 러닝화에 딱 어울릴만한 신발이에효너무 잘샀다 키키 잘 신고 런닝머신 열심히 할게효..,1
13,저는 발볼이넓고 발등이 높은편이라 한치수업해서 주문했어요 아주적당히 잘맛네요 쿠션감이 엄청좋은편이라 걸을때 발목이 편안할것같네요 생일쿠폰챙겨주셔서  저렴하게 구매했어요 심플한디자인이라 오래 신을수 있을것같아요,1
14,검정색이랑 흰색 중에 엄청 고민했는데 실내용으로 신을거라~흰색 구매했습니다.저는 235와 240 중간 사이즈인데 240 잘 맞아요.지난달에 무릎 십자인대 재건수술 하고 재활시 신을 가볍고 편한 신발 찾았는데 딱 좋아요.쿠셔닝도 적당하고 넘 맘에 들어요.글고~중요한건 넘 이쁩니다.^^,1
15,"사진대비실물이훨씬더이쁘네요.싸이즈도정싸이즈고,무엇보다키높이도돼고쿠션감도무척좋네요",1
16,편안하고 디자인도 만족! 정사이즈,1
17,편하고 좋아요. 키높이도 되고 편안해요.,1
18,"걷는 것을 상당히 좋아해 이에 특화된 슈즈가 없을까 하고 찾던 중 마음에 드는 모티바 모델을 찾아 구매! 발 사이즈가 300인데 정사이즈이며 나이키 삭스 신고 신으니 잘 맞습니다. 마사이 워킹슈즈가 연상되는 아치형 솔이 바르고 안정적인 자세의 워킹을 유도하고 쿠션감도 좋아 장시간 워킹에도 편안함이 기대이상입니다. 컬러는 실물이 좀더 강렬한 느낌이며 형광레드에 가깝습니다. 슈즈 특성상 러닝으로는 다소 부적합해 보이며 가벼운 트래킹이나 동네 산책, 잘 닦여진 산책로를 걸을 때 유용한 슈즈가 아닐까 생각합니다. 워킹에 특화된 슈즈가 필요한 분들께 강력추천드립니다.",1
19,"무릎이 안좋아서 나이키 줌 시리즈만 애용하는데,  무릎 충격 흡수도 잘 되고아치를 충분히 받쳐주어서 발이 아주 편합니다",1
20,물건입니다 진짜편하고 좋네요 👍👍👍👍,1
21,사이즈는 한사이즈업 하시면 됩니다.색감도 화려하고 디자인도 좋고 쿠션 푹신하고 만족합니다^^,1
22,"These are my one and only favorite walking shoes.   I bought the Nike Motiva walking shoe for my 14 day vacation to Europe. I wore them every single day and most evenings as I went on my excusions.  I did over 10,000 steps everyday and not once can I say that my feet hurt.  When I got back to the states I went and bought another pair. I am completely in love with these shoes.  I highly recommend  these shoes to anyone that does or will do a lot of walking.",1
23,Love them great fit. Love to work out and walk in these shoes. Fits true to size,1
24,Time I put these shoes on they immediately felt good!!  They are very springy/spongy right at the area of your arch!!!  1st pair of shoes I’ve put in in a while that I had that immediate reaction of “I Love These!”  And I’ve worn several pairs recently that just haven’t “done” it for me like Brooks & some On styles!  I’ll definitely be ordering another pair of these Nike Motiva’s in another color!!!,1
25,"Very comfortable, great walking shoes",1
26,I LOVE the Nike Motiva walking shoes!! I'm on my feet ALOT at work and they feel like I'm walking on a cloud. I love the design of the shoe and the many colors they come in!!! I normally wear a 7.5 in Nikes but since they run a little big I got them in a size 7.NIKE DO NOT STOP MAKING THESE AND DO NOT CHANGE THE DESIGN!!,0
27,"These are very comfortable walking shoes. I was not sure how well they would work for me, as Nike shoes tend to be a bit too narrow for my feet, but these were highly recommended so took a chance and ordered online. I tend to be between a 6 and a 6.5, ordered the 6.5 and it fits very well.",1
28,My wife loves this shoe! She bought it and worked out in it and came back all smiles! The cushion was perfect for the balls of her feet and the cylindrical design of the sole made the push and rock motion super easy…,1
29,My favorite work shoe. I’m standing for 9+ hrs a day and these are holding up very well. They are so comfortable. I am normally a size 5 but these fit more comfortably in a size 6.,1
30,The most comfortable and good looking shoes ever,1
31,"Very comfortable. Fits extremely true to size + wide, no need to size up as you may have to do with most running shoes, especially if you intend to use insoles. I sized up as I did with the wildhorse and experienced significant heel slippage, even with insoles. I returned and sized down 1/2 a size.",1
32,"Ordered these at the end of June for work, where I am on my feet walking around for 40+ hrs/wk on concrete and walk an average of about 8-10 miles per day. They were super comfortable and I never had any foot pain, however by September I had completely worn through the bottoms of them. At this price point, I had hoped they would last me much longer, but I would order them again if I needed a pair of casual walking shoes.",1
33,"These shoes are super comfortable at first try on and I love the rocker sole, very bouncy. I have a medium to wide foot and the toe box fit perfectly. The only thing is that they were a bit too short. I wear a women's 8 in regular shoes and usually an 8.5 in running / walking shoes and I have to exchange these for a 9.",1
34,I love this shoe! They feel great they look great. My walking pace increased with these shoes. Nike please drop more colorways in size 14 or drop the Motiva 2.,1
35,One of the best comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I don't feel tired anymore.Context: I walk for 8 hours straight at work,1
36,Absolutely love them. I have wide feet and plantar fasciitis and was struggling in my sketchers slip ins and these feel like they were made for me. They are super comfortable. I'm usually an 8 but went to a size 8.5 and they are perfect 👌,1
37,"I work as a RN in the Emergency Department, 6”1 and 260lbs and these shoes are golden for my 12hrs shift!",1
38,"The Motivas are great for my walking regimen. The big, thick soles make me feel like I'm walking on air instead of concrete and they propel me foward so that I complete my walk in about half the time. This also allows me to walk further.As to comfort, I don't know if I'd walk around in these all day, but for my walks - 2.5 to 4 miles - they are great.The reason I'm abandoning my",1
39,"These are the most comfortable shoes I own, I highly recommend them.",1
40,"These shoes surprised me honestly. I usually wear running shoes or hiking shoes for long walks, but the extra cushion and rocker sole shape make these the best I’ve ever worn for walks exceeding a couple miles.",1
41,"I’ve had these shoes during my military training and I can attest that these are the most plush, most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. Not even HOKAs can match this level of plushiness. Truly one of my best investments, since I felt I could run for miles upon miles with these things. If only I could have gotten the hot pink ones, because I bought the white/light purple ones; it’s a shame",1
42,"I have 2 pairs of these, I am on my feet all day on hard concrete. If I wear any other pair of sneakers to work my legs ache, my feet hurt and I'm miserable. Took a chance bought a pair on sale then got extra 25% and paid $58 , I wish I had bought 2 pair. I get off my legs don't hurt and I don't feel so exhausted. I highly recommend if your on your feet all day these are the ones. Thank you Nike!!",1
43,"I am a 60 year old, and these shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. These shoes bounce you up with every step!  You can walk forever in these shoes!  They actually bounce you to your next step. I am walking faster and no foot pain at all!  Love Nike❤️",1
44,Definitely different.  There is good arch support.  I like the look of them too.,1
45,"Very comfortable, very well cushioned. I wear these to walk several miles each day and I'm very happy with the feel. Good price and good look. I wear a 7 1/2 shoe and I ordered the 7 1/2. I might have been able to go up half a size, but I'm satisfied with the 7 1/2.",1
46,"Amazing walking shoe! Best I’ve ever used, perfect for walking on city streets with all day comfort.",1
47,Best Walking Shoe Ever. I enjoy walking inside and out. These shoes are perfect and extremely comfortable. Don't wait they are worth it. You will not regret it.,1
48,"This is one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I'm a registered nurse and work 12 hour shifts. The hallways are long and my feet take a beating. I worn these to work and my feet did not hurt when I got home, but this shoe is not stylish or cute. Your foot sort of spreads out and the shoe looks huge.",1
49,Best walking shoes out there. I have a pair in almost every color! These are great if you are dealing with Plantar fasciitis or on your feet all day.  Buy you a pair or 5 NOW!!!!,1
50,"These shoes are the best, I have the black and tge white ones now. I’ve had two ankle surgeries in the past year and these shoes make walking so much easier and painless.",1
51,"Super comfortable. Nice fit, just snug at the heel with good toe room.",1
52,I’m an ICU nurse and these are perfect for being on your feet. The traction is excellent too on slippery surfaces. They fit my custom orthotics perfectly. I highly recommend. (I size up by half a size for Nike as compared to other shoe brands.),1
53,"I’m a nurse that walks 10000+ steps on concrete floors every shift and these shoes absorb every one of those steps! My last 2 pairs were Hokas and I loved the shock absorbing soles but both pairs had issues   (Hoka customer service replaced them with no issues), so I  wasn’t sold on the durability. Nike always fit my feet perfectly, so when I saw the Motivas, I pounced. I have been so happy with",0
54,Probably one of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. I highly recommend.,1
55,"Feels like walking on the clouds, I recently have been recovering from achilles rupture and these have helped take the pressure off so much. Love the rocking motion, nice and spongey. Nice wide toe box and easy slip on/off too.",1
56,"I walk 3+ miles a day for exercise and was having quite a lot of hip pain after a few months. I researched which shoes were recommended for walking specifically and saw these come up multiple times, so I gave them a shot. I am so happy I did! My hip pain has almost vanished after only using them for a couple weeks, and I feel so much better! I would recommend these to anyone who walks for fun or",1
57,"Looks really great, design-wise, fits very different. This show runs reeeally small, I had already ordered half a size bigger than my usual size as the reviews recommended this, was still way too small. Also this shoe is more for (very) narrow feet. Walking was very awkward, I felt like walking in those wood sandals, was not a smooth rolling of the sole. When you need to use orthopedic",1
58,Great comfortable shoe and I highly recommend them also purchased some for my wife and she also loved them,1
59,My only complaint is that they’re not slip resistant.,0
60,"Just got them as a birthday gift and so far so good. They are super comfortable, have a great arch support and it does feel like you are walking on a cloud. Thank you Nike for coming out with a good walking sneaker.",1
61,"I walk around 10 miles a day for my job, three days a week. After a year, I finally need a new pair. Incredible comfort. Can’t imagine walking in anything else.",1
62,"Discontinued blue ones. Not everyone likes white or red shoes. Some ppl enjoy the baby blue but I guess I didn't buy it fast enough. I bought the black ones, love them came for another but the color choices could be better :( still giving 5 stars for comfort. I should take out 2 stars for color. Once u feel these pillows under ur feet, u will never look at ur other uncomfy shoes again. I wish I had these pregnant.",0
63,Very comfy and supportive for walking. I went up half a size after reading reviews and would recommend this. Would love to see them in all black with a black sole too!,1
64,"Im usually hesitant to rave about a shoe. I have flat feet and when on my feet for a long duration they tent to cramp and hurt. I go these shoes on vacation in NYC. I wore these throughout the city.  They feel as if you’re on a rocking cloud. I love these shoes, so much I got a second pair.",1
65,"These shoes are brilliant. They have super soft and springy soles, which make them really comfortable. I wasn't sure if the shape would work on a pebbly beach but they seem to work well for all of my walk.",0
66,The BEST shoes I have ever bought!  Like walking on a cloud!  I wish I could buy more!,1
67,"These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I’m a server in a busy restaurant, and even after 12 hours on my feet I can’t feel the effects at all. They’re very cushioned and bouncy, and it’s like walking on air. I highly recommend for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet.",1
68,Purchased these shoes for a New York trip… I was instantly surprised how comfortable these felt from the moment I put them on! Great shoe for vacation when there’s a lot of walking involved…,1
69,"Overall shoes are great, look an fit wise. I do think there needs to be more cushion under the toe area. Walking while putting your heal down first an rolling the shoe tords your toes has a great feeling on my knees now that im in my late 40's. But my stride ends with pushing off of my toes, so a little more cushion would have been nice.",1
70,Very comfortable and I get a lot of compliments. Perfect work shoes for my long shifts. They are a little loud when walking ( due to the cushioning). But 10/10. I want to buy a 2nd pair in a different color.,1
71,"Soft wide toe box, awesome curve to the sole the help you take a step forward, cloud like cushion. Great for flat hard floors, would probably avoid for hills.  The shoe is so good I bought back up pairs and hope they release more colors!  A+",1
72,Love shoes..like walking on a cloud but needed a half size bigger.,0
73,Great quality shoes. Also the design is very cool!!,1
74,So comfortable to walk and run in. I got half a size bigger than usual as my toe rubbed with a size 6.Very bouncy feel in these trainers.,1
75,"Wow, these are so good I plan to buy a few more pairs. Extremely comfortable and no issues with durability so far. I'm not a huge runner but I didn't have any issuing running in them either. I've purchased many Nike shoes over the years and I think these are my favourite.",1
76,This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. Perfect appearance and good feeling.,1
77,"Nike PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE KEEP THIS SHOE. This is by far my all time favorite walking and light jogging shoe of all time. My feet feel like walking on a marshmallow/ cloud and I love the rocker on this that propels you forward. I can walk longer and I have absolutely no pain in my knees, joints or feet afterwards. I wear Pegasus 38’s and 40’s which are good for runs but these Motivas just",1
78,Love these shoes! They feel so soft.,1
79,"I love these shoes! Better than my other sneakers that started with an H. So comfy.  I can walk miles without foot, knee, or pain of any kind. Get these sneakers!",1
80,Very comfortable walking shoes I love the high arch that feels like having my custom made shoe inserts on. This shoe is made perfectly for my feet.,1
81,Nice quality nice for every day use,1
82,Very comfy walking shoes. I really like how they rock your foot forward. I did go up 1/2 a size from my usual size in these and got the size I purchase for metcons and air maxes.,1
83,Really comfortable trainers and look good. A bit tighter across the toes than my Pegasus but not too tight.,1
84,These walking shoes are so comfortable this picture does not do justice the ordering process was easy the delivery was really fast I walk for hour and my feet did not hurt at all I will be purchasing another pair,1
85,A very comfortable shoe. Very impressed,1
86,Very comfortable and suitable for a walk jog session.,1
87,"I’m pregnant and needed some new walking shoes for my aching feet. Let me tell you, these do not disappoint! Very comfortable and bouncy. I have arched feet, so they give me good support.",1
88,"I want to preface this by saying that I usually do not write reviews unless someone asks. I am writing this review because this is my all-time favorite shoe and I buy a lot of shoes. I own the Motiva and the Nike Invincible 3. I love them both. They feel similar, like walking on a cloud or a marshmallow. I use this shoe for walking mostly. I average 10,000 steps per day. I used them in Tokyo for 4",1
89,This is a nice shoe for walking. Wish I had brought sooner. Great shoes for the price. Definitely buying another pair in a different color,1
90,I love the shoes and would love to have them all black!,1
91,"So comfy. Fit true to my Nike size 10 as ever. I have previously used running trainers for my walking (just pavements / paths to get my steps in!), but these are superior. The emphasis is the rocker and cushioned heel makes it like walking on cloud - and they don’t have the same support / restriction that running trainers do. So this makes them more comfortable and breathable. Not sure how they’d hold up off-road, as they are great looking too!",1
92,Oh yes!!!!! Need it in all black instead of black and white please.,0
93,"Why three stars this is a good shoe, but is nowhere as soft as the INVINCIBLE RUN 3 The INVINCIBLE RUN 3 I still the softer more cushioned shoe. The INVINCIBLE RUN 3 is more stable and they don’t have the rocker effect like Nike Motiva. Why am I posting this review as I called customer service there was a lot of debate. No one was able to answer this question so I thought I’d add this onto",0
94,"I love these shoes so much!! I have been using them for walking on my peloton tread. First, a while back I had stopped wearing Nike on the tread because they hurt my knees so bad. I switched to another brand and it was like night and day. So when I bought these shoes I did it because I thought they were cute and figured I’d wear them in a fashionable way. When I first put them on I was shocked!!",1
95,"I’m a lifelong Nike brand user. So happy they have finally given us a true “walking” shoe. I am a power walker and absolutely love these shoes. Very comfortable right out of the box. Color choices are also very pleasing. Nike nailed it with these shoes. Just fyi, I wear a 9 in street shoes but always wear a 10 in Nike.  Thank you! 😊",1
96,"I purchased these ahead of a city trip which would involve a lot of walking. As a sufferer of plantar fasciitis I needed something that would cushion my heel and these worked a treat! They are lightweight and have a lovely thick sole that made it comfortable to walk on.Based on other reviews, I did buy 1 size bigger - I'd recommend this too!",1
97,"Like walking on a cloud! Very comfortable, I love the color as well! Received a lot of compliments!",1
98,I have many size 9 Nike shoes and being a lazy shoe lace tier I wiggle my foot into loosely tied shoes but with this pair is tied and untied every wearing so even though this is still quality Nike product it will be sparsely worn.The fitting is a little too tight compare with my previous shoes.If your a lazy wearer and product returner like me then I suggest order a 1/2 size larger than your usual size for a more satisfying and comfortable fitting.,0
99,Super comfortable! My new go to shoe.,1
100,They are so comfortable. I love them. I walk more than I run and I highly recommend them.,1
101,Very light and comfortable. True  to size,1
102,Love these sneakers but need a WIDE. Can you kindly offer wide in the future.,1
103,Nike Motiva is fabulous. Its comfy and stylish. Product was delivered earlier than expected. Very impressed,1
104,"Love, love, love these!  I bought these specifically for walking and they are so comfortable. They are so comfortable. I normally wear a 7.5 but they didn’t have my size so I ordered the 8 and they fit great!",1
105,"I found this shoe to be unlike any shoe I’ve ever worn. As a person with balance issues, the Motiva took some getting used to because of the “slight rocking motion” I felt when I first started wearing them. In time I became used to them not being very flat and found them to be extremely comfortable during my 13 hour work days as a daycare owner. Jumping, running and the occasional climbing kept my",1
106,"Had to get a half size up but great shoes. Perfect for long walks, not sure I’d run in them.",1
107,"Great walking trainer, lots of support in the sole, leave you with a bounce in your step!",1
108,"Love these trainers, super comfy and stylish.",1
109,It’s only been 1 week since I’ve had them but so far so good. I purchased these for work bc I’m actively on my feet but I rotate my shoes quite frequently…I read a lot of reviews about these before deciding to purchase but I can honestly say that many of the reviews were Spot on…..extremely comfortable and light in my opinion. Great walking shoes. I’m considering purchasing another pair. Hope this helps!,1

124,"발볼이 넓어서 보통 280 신었는데 나이키는 반업도 아닌 한 업해서 290신어야 발가락 간섭이 없더라고요. 대신에 신발끈을 꽉 조여서 뒤꿈치 덜렁거리지 않게 해야했고요. 바닥에 딱 달라붙는 느낌이 좋네요. 서 있을 때 안정감이 좋습니다. 러닝화는 쿠션이 좋아서 발목이 불안불안 하다면 요건 웨이트 하라고 만든것 같습니다. 비교로 줌메트콘 터보도 신어봤는데 이게 훨씬 안정감이 느껴집니다. 명동매장에 다행이 모델별로 비교해서 신어보고 결정하니 배송, 반품에 시간낭비가 줄어서 좋습니다. 직원들도 정말 친절하세요.",1

127,다른 운동화랑 비교했을때 길이는 비슷하나 폭이 조금 좁아서 발볼이 넓거나 조금 여유롭게 신고싶으면 반업 하시는게 좋을거 같습니다. 메트콘이라 확실히 가볍고 바닥은 앞쪽은 얇고 뒤꿈치쪽은 두꺼운게 확실하게 느껴집니다.,1
128,사이즈 팁 드리자면 저는 발볼 약간 있고나이키 신발들은 260신는데 메트콘6 같은 경우에는 반업 해서 265 신고 있었습니다.이번 메트콘9도 양말도 신고 생각보다잘 늘어날거 같지 않아서 반업해서 265 구입하였는데딱 잘 맞는것 같습니다.,1
129,오늘 제품을 받자마자 바로 신어보았습니다. 처음에 신을때 발이 들어갈땐 약간 불편하다?끼는 느낌인데 딱 들어가는 순간 편안함을 제공해주네요 전 발볼이 조금 있는편이라 나이키는 농구화 일반화 모두 반업해서 신어요 275인데 나이키는 다 280입니다 이 신발도 반업해서 신었는데 앞쪽이 살짝 남지만 크게 문제가 되진 않아요 앞쪽이 남는다고 발볼 있으신분들 정사이즈 가시면 약간 불편할수도 있을듯하네요 운동양말 신고 신으면 딱 맞아요 모두 이 신발 신고 득근하세요,1
130,"Within 1 month, the sole had worn through to the plastic “lift wedge” in the heel. Now when I walk/run there is an annoying “click/tap” sound from the plastic hitting the concrete or asphalt. Within 6 weeks, the interior liner in the counter/heel cup had worn through. Very underwhelming durability for a “training” shoe. Especially when previous Metcon models were very well made.",1
131,Comfortable im enjoying them very much,1
132,Love the shoes. Wider fit which is hard to find. Will definitely order again.,1
133,I love the shoes that I bought.,1
134,Stylish working out trainer. Nicely sized and comfortable Well priced,1
135,I Usually get the metcons  for training because I CrossFit but the style has changed they are bulkier and heavier the look is wider as well so it makes the foot appear bigger. This was my 4th pair  and sadly I’ll be returning these. I need something lightweight that’s still good for lifting,1
136,Extremely Uncomfortable had to return,0
137,"These simply do not hold up. They are extremely comfortable, which is why I gave them a two instead of a one. The outer sole wears away on the heal very easily. Once that is gone it sounds like you’re wearing tap shoes every time you take a step. Nike needs to fix this design flaw in the next version.",1
138,Very nice fitting shoe true to size,1
139,The shoe is extremely comfortable and arrived remarkably quickly.,1
140,I sprained my ankle in previous Metcon's... So I bought these Metcon 9's specifically for the stability and I love them! I stress tested my ankle in them for months and I cannot see an easy to sprain my ankle again. The stability and stiffness of the materials does create more noise while walking but it's worth it.,1
141,My son said these are very good shoes for his football workouts. They are comfortable and work for lifting and running.,1
142,"Loving the atomic orange colorway. I thought it was too bright initially, but this is exactly the jolt of energy you need while doing a training routine.",1
143,Cool colorway. Great price. Quick delivery,1
144,Goid shoeStylishComfortable Loved the color,1
145,Wish you could make the back half of the bottom sole longer so your heel is above the toes. In a nut shell bigger rubber on back half of sole,0
146,"Looks good, great fit and very comfortable. So glad I bought them",1
147,"Very comfortable gym shoes. I love it. When working out in the gym, people were asking were I bought it from.",1
148,Loved the look but the rubber wears out quickly on the heel and you become a tap dancer! Plastic contact on pavement is loud! Had to throw them away,0
149,I purchased the metcon 9 over the 8 due to price and availability so we will see how these hold up. Originally bought two pair of the metcon 8's each lasting six months before a hole would form in the middle front and the material on the heel started to come off. Also the 8's had an issue of the sole separating from the shoe in the front so I wanted to give the 9's a chance to see if they hold up,0
150,"Fit is as good as the 8s, which were the best fitting metcons that I’ve had.  Price was great on this color and was why I",1
151,Good materials. Ran a little big,1
152,Improved over my Metcon 7’s. Better for short runs. But toe box is much roomier-may want to order half size smaller. Shoes also feel a little hot during tough workouts.,1
153,Bought twice and both have had the same issue with a part of the sole coming lose within 6-8 weeks. Nike will refund you but it’s not a straight forward process. Would not recommend if you do crossfit.,0
154,Glad I decided to splurge on these. Have been needing a new pair of gym shoes for a while! Can’t go wrong with a pair of metcons! Wish they would’ve had the free metcons in the store bud very happy with these!,1
155,"Great solid shoe for cross training, great stability for weight lifting but feel a little bulky to run in. They look great too!",1
156,BEST WORKOUT SHOE EVER !! FOR MY STRENGHT TRAINING,1
157,"Good fit was the same fit as the metcon 7, just pay attention to the Women or Men size when u buy them.",0
158,"Aesthetics RULE! And, when it comes “Aesthetics.” NiKE’s are KiNG! The COMFORT & FEEL, for GyM LiFE MOVEMENTS, are “GRADE A STANDARD.” I Love Them.",1
159,Exceptional stability and comfort for those that have mixed workout style. I have tried the variety of cross training / functional style shoes and so far the metcons gym stability and fit for movement is the strongest.,1
160,"Definitely stable shoes for lunges and squats which is what I am doing. Took them on a 4 mile walk and I could definitely tell I should of used other shoes.I like the look, feel and support. Exactly what I needed.",1
161,"Overall look is pretty cool. Overall feel and quality is horrible. Sides are so stiff it's bruising the underside of my ankle bone. Within a month not even working out in them, the rubber is coming off in chunks just leaving plastic at the very back of heel. When I'm walking there's a plastic noise hitting the floor with every step which is super annoying. Overall I hate them and do not wear them anymore.",0
162,"Physical Therapist here. Been wearing these for about 4 months now, for both lifting and work. I have to say they are one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn in a minute. As someone who talks/recommends shoes on the regular, this is the first shoe Nike that I will endorse. As a size 14 with a bunion and very picky, these have met all my expectations and I will be buying a pair in white. Cheers y'all.",1
163,I am very pleased with the trainers. Look good and perform really well in training. Had to go down a half size for the fitting. Also bought the Air Alpha’s in the matching colours.,1
164,"Still only a few weeks old and they're good for the gym floor, especially for things like back weight squats, deadlifts etc where I've taken my trainers off in the past for. Only slight niggle is the top of the shoe around the lower ankle is quite rigid but I'm guessing that will ease after some more use.",1
165,"I've noticed that Nike's recycled components shoes tend to be incredibly uncomfortable with very little give. This shoe was almost great, but the plastic that wraps around the side pulls very uncomfortably and does not allow for natural foot movements.",0
166,"First time wearing CrossFit trainers , absolutely love them they make such a difference to stability when lifting.",1
167,I love them the delivery was spot on everything was perfect,1
168,Best training shoe I’ve worn. Comfortable for walking and cardio training as well.,1
169,I was disappointed. Felt so heavy and slippery on tiles.,0
170,"These are great lifting shoes. They are sturdy, comfortable and look great on the feet.",1
171,"Overall a good shoe. They fit wider than most Nikes I’ve tried on in the past. My foot isn’t wide enough for a wide EE shoe, but most Nikes strangle my foot so these are a perfect fit for me. They are a little loud and clunky to run in but that’s not what they’re intended for so it’s not that big of a deal. Would have given it 5 stars but for $150 the quality control is lacking . I got the black and grey ones and there’s visible glue all over the shoe.",1
172,Sole delaminating from plate on heel after only 3 months.,0
173,I absolutely love these. It’s the best Meton evolution ever. This is my second pair that I bought within 30 days. Love them for working out CrossFit Pickleball. It’s a great all around shoe,1
174,Good shoes ....nice to wear...fit size color amazing...,1
175,"Honestly, thee best Metcon so far. Admittedly, I found these awful and plain looking initially. After finally purchasing, I was silenced when I realized the true quality of this shoe. Heavy lifts, circuits, and daily use; this model has covered it all. Smooth while walking and handling daily tasks, yet sturdy for crossfit, but grounded for compound movements. The amount of detail that has gone",0
176,"Really wish they would go back to the Metcon 5 style.. every year these get bulkier, heavier and stiffer. These have wayyy to much padding around the shoe and it feels thick and heavy. Definitely can’t do any running in these. I’ve owned many pairs of the metcons and these are by far the worst.",0
177,Fits true to size and very comfortable. Love how stable they are when doing squats. Feels great to lift in.,1
178,"Very nice and stylish 😎 I really love it,it's comfortable",1
179,Design is so much uglier than the Metcon 8. Please re-evaulate your design process. If I could return order for the nike ID custom design Metcon 8's I would.,0
180,I love these shoes...they are super comfortable and they look awesome.,1
181,Great shoes.  Fit well.  Work well when doing my Hiit exercise.,1
182,"Oof where to start. First they are not a good looking shoe (I was hoping the feel and functionality would help overlook this and just never looking down). Second, this thing feels like a boot. If you like Metcon 6s, Nano 2.0, or Nano 4.0 you're probably going to hate these shoes as I do. Third, the middle sole is carved out for the rope rubber and it makes them feel less stable for lifting because",0
183,"I love these shoes! Perfect for every aspect of my gym workout! Plenty of support, and fit comfortably.",1
184,So far my favorite Metcon.  Perfect in the gym and not as clunky as the previous model for short runs. They feel extremely light on your feet.,1
185,"Great shoe, amazing for any lift or form of weightlifting",1
186,"Excellent, they are super comfortable and do not bother you when lifting weights",1
187,Love these shoes for deadlifts and squats. They fit great . Look great!,1
188,"Comfortably , good material ten stars",1
189,"I love it, everything was perfect on time",1
190,This is my 4th version of Metcons and I can confidently say this is by far the best Metcon. The toe box is slightly wider than previous versions and the upper is much more flexible for more cardio workouts.,1
191,"Good lifting shoes, but the Metcon’s get uglier every year, with worse integration of the rope guard. It’s now just a giant chunk of rubber glued on the side. The 4s were so much nicer looking. Just reissue those.",0
192,Great for lifting and rope climbs. Not so great for running. My previous Metcon 5s were a little better all around CrossFit shoe. I will definitely wear different shoes for workouts with any amount of running.,1
193,"First pair of workout sneakers, Major difference from non workout footwear. Increased balanced was the first significant noticeable change. Second was improved form.",0
194,"I wanted to like this shoe. Toe box looked large and I have had success with the fit of previous versions of the Metcon.But this shoe is really heavy, inflexible, and fits like a boat.I can get the stiffness as the goal was for more stability, but the fit is sloppy. Loose on top and no way to really snug it down.It seems to be made for a really high volume foot.",1
195,"I really liked these, until my first workout with kipping HSPU - the outsole completely ripped away from the shoe on the heels, massive build oversight. Never had this happen with the previous few metcons or Nanos. Disappointing.",0
196,"The first workout shoe I feel comfortable in. Can't recommend enough, finally not tearing my heel open like that other brand.",1
197,"Shoe is decent, a bit stiff and uncomfortable, almost like a weight-lifting shoe. The shoe has this big area to protect it from ripping when doing rope climbs, but my shoe actually ripped on the bottom of the shoe on the first rope climb workout I did (7 total rope climbs). The Nike return process isn't great - you send the shoes in at your cost, then you get a voucher for the retail of the shoes",0
198,I bought this as my first gym shoe and it has not disappointed. I previously used normal trainers and could feel the difference. It gave me a good solid base for my deadlifts and squats. I wouldn’t recommend for long runs but it is good for running as a warm up on the treadmill before a work out,0
199,Absolutely love these . I’ve had Metcons previously but these are a definite upgrade . They have the same sturdiness which is great for the gym but are much more comfortable than before meaning they are also great for cardio as well as weight training .,1
200,My first dedicated workout shoe and it makes a ton of difference in my stability when I lift. my feet and body feel so stable and the shoe is super comfortable and stylish at the same time. they really put some features in this shoe to help in the gym I'm a fan now,1
201,Great you give lots of stability while working out highly recommend them,1
202,"The Nike Metcon 9 AMP boasts top-tier quality materials, ensuring both durability and optimal stability. Truly a game-changer for fitness enthusiasts!",1
203,"Great shoes for CrossFit and gym training, stability is awesome and design is stunning. however, the sole is ripping off on the first wear on both the shoes at the same corner looks like a manufacturing defect.",1
204,Owned a few Metcons in the past and the quality wasn’t there including what it was supposed to do - ie stability and comfort - the holy grail of getting both right. The 9 AMP changed all of that. It’s probably the best shoe I have ever used and meets all the criteria’s set out by NIKE. All I ask for NIKE is please produce more colours!,1
205,"Feel great, better fit than previous model. However, they are too hot, they don’t breathe all that well.",1
206,Huge improvement in comfort and stability with more room for the toes. I will be buying another pair.,1
207,"I've got over 30 Metcons in my CF arsenal, starting since the 4s.  The Metcon 9 is by far the BEST trainer of all time.  Why?  Because it's wider overall base and forefoot creates more stability when preforming functional fitness movements, which gives the athlete confidence to push up the intensity during the WOD.  The cushioning feels softer than the 7 or 8s, which is a good thing, but it",1
208,The improvement of the shoes are significant with stability and with a wider toebox to take a better grip with the toes for cleans and snatches. Running and cardio workouts are a  more comfortable.,1
209,"I’ve owned previous generations of Metcons and these are the best ones yet. Even though they have a slightly higher profile, they feel incredibly stable and firm. These are as good as it gets for squatting and heavy lifting, without buying powerlifting shoes. Love the new flap for hiding the shoe laces and I would, overall, just highlight the high quality build of this shoe.",1
210,"Right out of the gate I love the design of this shoe, really modern and sleek. They’re great for the gym. Super comfortable, breathable and offer great stability during workouts. But they’re also great for all day wear. Found myself wearing them while running errands and they felt really nice, cool and lightweight. All around these are awesome shoes that I’d recommend to anyone.",1
211,Wider toe box is game changer 🔥 comfortable and you feel better the power of the foots,1
212,The shoes are attractive. I received multiple unsolicited comments about how cool they looked. I have a wide foot and these shoes felt very accommodating. They are somewhat stiff with less padding than I would have preferred on the sides and bottom- could probably benefit from a gel insert.  The rubber on the sole of the shoe felt a little stiff and was a little noisier on hard surfaces than a,1
213,"My husband wore these to the gym for his workout and he felt that while they were durable and high quality, the shoes felt heavy on his feet. They felt comfortable while he was walking around but they sounded loud and he didn't like running in them. He said there didn't seem to be much shock absorption.",0
214,"When I first received them, I couldn't wait to try them on! I have been searching to find a good fit cross trainer for my weight training workouts, and these shoes are just right! They slide on very easily, and are very comfortable and fit true to size. I have used them several times and they are so comfy and provide amazing support during my personal training sessions and weight training workouts! I highly recommend these!",1
215,"I am primarily a runner (3-5 runs/10 miles per week) who is looking to get in some additional at-home cardio and strength training, and needed a solid shoe to help get me through backyard and basement workouts (primarily HIIT). The Nike Metcon 9 fit the bill. I expect a lot out of my shoes, and sometimes struggle to find something that balances comfort with strength. After a few weeks wearing",1
216,"I actually love these shoes for comfort and style. I am by no means a CrossFit person, but still really like wearing these for all day wear to make sure I'm comfortable and don't have to worry about my feet aching after doing a lot of walking. I'm a Midwest mom and even taking my kids to the county fairs my feet felt fine the whole time -- if you know, you know.",1
217,These shoes are solid and have a sleek look. They are breathable and have a comfortable design. They are versatile and can be used for everyday wear as well as the gym. They don’t have as much arch support as other shoes I have worn but are still a great pair of shoes. The only thing I would recommend is not covering up the Nike logo as much.,1
218,"My job requires me to be on my feet all day and run back and forth from one end of a building to the other. I usually peel off my shoes at the end of the day and rest my aching feet. These shoes are quite the game changer. I spent all day with them on, cycled home, and went for a run with little discomfort. They appear to be well made and durable, so we will have to see how long I take to run them",1
219,"Imagine our delight when we opened the box and saw the ""cool as fudge"" Metcons staring back at us. The whole family gathered to ooh and ahh over the shoes. My husband wore them around the house, said they felt very comfortable and looked so stylish. According to my husband, they're flat enough to feel comfortable while lifting weights and have some support for jumps, etc. Keep coming up with interesting new shoes Nike!",0
220,Great shoes. Im a size 13 and bought a sz 14 beauty i heard they run big. They do run big just wish they had sz 13.5 so i can have more of a snug fit for training. More comfortable than free metcon,1
221,"Nike has a special shoe here. I wonder why it took so long. Think of a Metcon with some cushion, not too much, just enough to make a mile run doable. They are true to your Metcon size. Extremely comfortable, wide toes box and they look super cool. I been looking for months for a comfortable shoe for functional fitness, this is the shoe. I been wearing Metcons since the original one but been wanting a more comfortable shoe. More colors ASAP please. Well done Nike!",1
222,Love the look. Seems like they would be comfortable but very undersized. For reference I wear size 12 in Jordan 1’s and purchased 12.5 in these TR1’s but need to size up to a 13. Would recommend - but size up accordingly.,0
223,"Not only do they look good, but as a person that works out 6-7days a week these felt amazing. Lite in weight, very supportive on the sides and top, cushioned. Top Tier Training Shoe. Can’t wait For More Colors.",1
224,"The LeBron TR 1 strikes the ideal balance of looks and functionality in an every day trainer. I personally put the trainers through a 3 hour leg day on first wear and they were incredibly comfortable and performed very well on a multitude of lifts ranging from Olympic to isolation. I’ve been a fan of the Mat Fraser Metcon’s for generations now, however the new LeBron TR 1 will be replacing those as my favorite gym trainers. Cannot wait for more color-ways!",1
225,I’m a true size 14 in everything Nike but suggest you go up a size than normal. These are general fitness type trainers. I have every metcon/ nano to compare these too. Because of the restriction of the shoe size I had to wear them without socks but the material made them feel actually better without them on. These are good north south trainers. I wouldn’t do any heavy easy west cutting in them.,0
226,"Stable heel and high, firm arch support.  The outside rubber extends beyond my small toes and restricts movement.  Feels narrow.",1
227,"Love the cable wire laces, cross trainers are great shoes and the fact Our Gloriouos King Lebron James can step into the realm of other shoe styles besides just basketball shoes shows how great my king really is.",1

These sneakers are versatile for the entire package and I'm impressed. Good job Nike.",1

I tried The Metcon 5 and a couple others, but none were as good as these.

It seems like I may never find another shoe as good as my superreps, but these are the next best thing I’ve found.",1

Enter this shoe with the perfect amount of cushion to allow you to do all activities whilst also keeping you stable and secure under the iron. 9/10, only feedback would be that the cushion around the ankle could be a little softer. Keep them coming and more colour ways please!",1
255,Very comfortable shoe that makes HIIT workouts awesome. The toe area is not stiff for anything like Bulgarian Splits or Mountain Climbers but I don’t mind that. Sometimes in HIIT classes we are required to run and it’s not comfortable in the METCON’s. I use METCON for gym only lifting and these for HIIT. I have the bone colored pair and these and they get dirty fast doing HIIT but I have good shoe,1

258,"Cushion is comfortable, but the toe box is kinda loose. Fabric on toe box doesn’t hug your foot like knit.",0
259,Flat out the most comfortable shoes I have. Nike needs to take this shoe and change the upper to a slip on for house slippers.,1
260,Finally!  The perfect Nike shoe for plyometric workouts.  I love Metcons for lifting and Pegasus for running/dailys.  Up until now I’ve had to wear other brands for group class workouts.  It was time for a new pair of shoes and so glad I gave the TR1 a shot.  Great spring/bounce around the balls of the feet.  Good toe support especially for the big toe.  And now my ankles/shins don’t hurt from,1
261,The fit is solid and the sole is great.  The inside of the shoe tends the buckle and bend on the inside of the arch.  Probably due to the weakest part of the she potentially being where the ventilation holes are on the inside,1

266,Comfortable but they run bigger. Not easy to put and take them off.  Wouldn’t recommend this for summer as the materials make your feet warm in the heat and with training. Overall these are ok.,0
267,They ok but borrow at back of heel,0
268,Love these firm at the back for lifting nice cushioning at forefoot for running . Toe box is quite low for better hold run true to size . No idea how I’ll keep them clean !!! If your a none rope climber CrossFit hiit or gym goer these are for you .,0

277,헬스화로 최고입니다. 견고하고 튼튼하네요.사이즈는 조금 크게 나왔습니다. 볼 넓은 족형에어포스 260 길이 살짝 길게 볼 잘맞게 신습니다. 메트콘260 길이 적당하고 볼 잘맞습니다.얘만 유독 사람들 말이 갈리던데 안전하게 정사이즈 추천드립니다. 동사이즈 기준 포스가 미세하게 깁니다.,1

282,크로스핏으로 아주 좋습니다👏👏,1
283,"발볼이 넓어서 보통 280 신었는데 나이키는 반업도 아닌 한 업해서 290신어야 발가락 간섭이 없더라고요. 대신에 신발끈을 꽉 조여서 뒤꿈치 덜렁거리지 않게 해야했고요. 바닥에 딱 달라붙는 느낌이 좋네요. 서 있을 때 안정감이 좋습니다. 러닝화는 쿠션이 좋아서 발목이 불안불안 하다면 요건 웨이트 하라고 만든것 같습니다. 비교로 줌메트콘 터보도 신어봤는데 이게 훨씬 안정감이 느껴집니다. 명동매장에 다행이 모델별로 비교해서 신어보고 결정하니 배송, 반품에 시간낭비가 줄어서 좋습니다. 직원들도 정말 친절하세요.",1
284,실물로 보니 신발 이쁘네요  사이즈 반업 하니 딱 맞네요 ~,1

286,다른 운동화랑 비교했을때 길이는 비슷하나 폭이 조금 좁아서 발볼이 넓거나 조금 여유롭게 신고싶으면 반업 하시는게 좋을거 같습니다. 메트콘이라 확실히 가볍고 바닥은 앞쪽은 얇고 뒤꿈치쪽은 두꺼운게 확실하게 느껴집니다.,1
287,사이즈 팁 드리자면 저는 발볼 약간 있고나이키 신발들은 260신는데 메트콘6 같은 경우에는 반업 해서 265 신고 있었습니다.이번 메트콘9도 양말도 신고 생각보다잘 늘어날거 같지 않아서 반업해서 265 구입하였는데딱 잘 맞는것 같습니다.,1
288,오늘 제품을 받자마자 바로 신어보았습니다. 처음에 신을때 발이 들어갈땐 약간 불편하다?끼는 느낌인데 딱 들어가는 순간 편안함을 제공해주네요 전 발볼이 조금 있는편이라 나이키는 농구화 일반화 모두 반업해서 신어요 275인데 나이키는 다 280입니다 이 신발도 반업해서 신었는데 앞쪽이 살짝 남지만 크게 문제가 되진 않아요 앞쪽이 남는다고 발볼 있으신분들 정사이즈 가시면 약간 불편할수도 있을듯하네요 운동양말 신고 신으면 딱 맞아요 모두 이 신발 신고 득근하세요,1
289,"Within 1 month, the sole had worn through to the plastic “lift wedge” in the heel. Now when I walk/run there is an annoying “click/tap” sound from the plastic hitting the concrete or asphalt. Within 6 weeks, the interior liner in the counter/heel cup had worn through. Very underwhelming durability for a “training” shoe. Especially when previous Metcon models were very well made.",1
290,Comfortable im enjoying them very much,1
291,Love the shoes. Wider fit which is hard to find. Will definitely order again.,1

293,Stylish working out trainer. Nicely sized and comfortable Well priced,1
294,I Usually get the metcons  for training because I CrossFit but the style has changed they are bulkier and heavier the look is wider as well so it makes the foot appear bigger. This was my 4th pair  and sadly I’ll be returning these. I need something lightweight that’s still good for lifting,1
295,Extremely Uncomfortable had to return,0
296,"These simply do not hold up. They are extremely comfortable, which is why I gave them a two instead of a one. The outer sole wears away on the heal very easily. Once that is gone it sounds like you’re wearing tap shoes every time you take a step. Nike needs to fix this design flaw in the next version.",1
297,Very nice fitting shoe true to size,1
298,The shoe is extremely comfortable and arrived remarkably quickly.,1
299,I sprained my ankle in previous Metcon's... So I bought these Metcon 9's specifically for the stability and I love them! I stress tested my ankle in them for months and I cannot see an easy to sprain my ankle again. The stability and stiffness of the materials does create more noise while walking but it's worth it.,1
300,My son said these are very good shoes for his football workouts. They are comfortable and work for lifting and running.,1

302,Cool colorway. Great price. Quick delivery,1

306,"Very comfortable gym shoes. I love it. When working out in the gym, people were asking were I bought it from.",1
307,Loved the look but the rubber wears out quickly on the heel and you become a tap dancer! Plastic contact on pavement is loud! Had to throw them away,0
308,I purchased the metcon 9 over the 8 due to price and availability so we will see how these hold up. Originally bought two pair of the metcon 8's each lasting six months before a hole would form in the middle front and the material on the heel started to come off. Also the 8's had an issue of the sole separating from the shoe in the front so I wanted to give the 9's a chance to see if they hold up,0
309,"Fit is as good as the 8s, which were the best fitting metcons that I’ve had.  Price was great on this color and was why I",1
310,Good materials. Ran a little big,1
311,Improved over my Metcon 7’s. Better for short runs. But toe box is much roomier-may want to order half size smaller. Shoes also feel a little hot during tough workouts.,1
312,Bought twice and both have had the same issue with a part of the sole coming lose within 6-8 weeks. Nike will refund you but it’s not a straight forward process. Would not recommend if you do crossfit.,0
313,Glad I decided to splurge on these. Have been needing a new pair of gym shoes for a while! Can’t go wrong with a pair of metcons! Wish they would’ve had the free metcons in the store bud very happy with these!,1

317,"Aesthetics RULE! And, when it comes “Aesthetics.” NiKE’s are KiNG! The COMFORT & FEEL, for GyM LiFE MOVEMENTS, are “GRADE A STANDARD.” I Love Them.",1
318,Exceptional stability and comfort for those that have mixed workout style. I have tried the variety of cross training / functional style shoes and so far the metcons gym stability and fit for movement is the strongest.,1
319,"Definitely stable shoes for lunges and squats which is what I am doing. Took them on a 4 mile walk and I could definitely tell I should of used other shoes.I like the look, feel and support. Exactly what I needed.",1
320,"Overall look is pretty cool. Overall feel and quality is horrible. Sides are so stiff it's bruising the underside of my ankle bone. Within a month not even working out in them, the rubber is coming off in chunks just leaving plastic at the very back of heel. When I'm walking there's a plastic noise hitting the floor with every step which is super annoying. Overall I hate them and do not wear them anymore.",0
321,"Physical Therapist here. Been wearing these for about 4 months now, for both lifting and work. I have to say they are one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn in a minute. As someone who talks/recommends shoes on the regular, this is the first shoe Nike that I will endorse. As a size 14 with a bunion and very picky, these have met all my expectations and I will be buying a pair in white. Cheers y'all.",1
322,I am very pleased with the trainers. Look good and perform really well in training. Had to go down a half size for the fitting. Also bought the Air Alpha’s in the matching colours.,1
323,"Still only a few weeks old and they're good for the gym floor, especially for things like back weight squats, deadlifts etc where I've taken my trainers off in the past for. Only slight niggle is the top of the shoe around the lower ankle is quite rigid but I'm guessing that will ease after some more use.",1
324,"I've noticed that Nike's recycled components shoes tend to be incredibly uncomfortable with very little give. This shoe was almost great, but the plastic that wraps around the side pulls very uncomfortably and does not allow for natural foot movements.",0
325,"First time wearing CrossFit trainers , absolutely love them they make such a difference to stability when lifting.",1
326,I love them the delivery was spot on everything was perfect,1
327,Best training shoe I’ve worn. Comfortable for walking and cardio training as well.,1
328,I was disappointed. Felt so heavy and slippery on tiles.,0
329,"These are great lifting shoes. They are sturdy, comfortable and look great on the feet.",1
330,"Overall a good shoe. They fit wider than most Nikes I’ve tried on in the past. My foot isn’t wide enough for a wide EE shoe, but most Nikes strangle my foot so these are a perfect fit for me. They are a little loud and clunky to run in but that’s not what they’re intended for so it’s not that big of a deal. Would have given it 5 stars but for $150 the quality control is lacking . I got the black and grey ones and there’s visible glue all over the shoe.",1
331,Sole delaminating from plate on heel after only 3 months.,0
332,I absolutely love these. It’s the best Meton evolution ever. This is my second pair that I bought within 30 days. Love them for working out CrossFit Pickleball. It’s a great all around shoe,1
333,Good shoes ....nice to wear...fit size color amazing...,1
334,"Honestly, thee best Metcon so far. Admittedly, I found these awful and plain looking initially. After finally purchasing, I was silenced when I realized the true quality of this shoe. Heavy lifts, circuits, and daily use; this model has covered it all. Smooth while walking and handling daily tasks, yet sturdy for crossfit, but grounded for compound movements. The amount of detail that has gone",0
335,"Really wish they would go back to the Metcon 5 style.. every year these get bulkier, heavier and stiffer. These have wayyy to much padding around the shoe and it feels thick and heavy. Definitely can’t do any running in these. I’ve owned many pairs of the metcons and these are by far the worst.",0
336,Fits true to size and very comfortable. Love how stable they are when doing squats. Feels great to lift in.,1
337,"Very nice and stylish 😎 I really love it,it's comfortable",1
338,Design is so much uglier than the Metcon 8. Please re-evaulate your design process. If I could return order for the nike ID custom design Metcon 8's I would.,0
339,I love these shoes...they are super comfortable and they look awesome.,1
340,Great shoes.  Fit well.  Work well when doing my Hiit exercise.,1
341,"Oof where to start. First they are not a good looking shoe (I was hoping the feel and functionality would help overlook this and just never looking down). Second, this thing feels like a boot. If you like Metcon 6s, Nano 2.0, or Nano 4.0 you're probably going to hate these shoes as I do. Third, the middle sole is carved out for the rope rubber and it makes them feel less stable for lifting because",0
342,"I love these shoes! Perfect for every aspect of my gym workout! Plenty of support, and fit comfortably.",1
343,So far my favorite Metcon.  Perfect in the gym and not as clunky as the previous model for short runs. They feel extremely light on your feet.,1
344,"Great shoe, amazing for any lift or form of weightlifting",1

347,"Comfortably , good material ten stars",1
348,"I love it, everything was perfect on time",1
349,This is my 4th version of Metcons and I can confidently say this is by far the best Metcon. The toe box is slightly wider than previous versions and the upper is much more flexible for more cardio workouts.,1
350,"Good lifting shoes, but the Metcon’s get uglier every year, with worse integration of the rope guard. It’s now just a giant chunk of rubber glued on the side. The 4s were so much nicer looking. Just reissue those.",0
351,Great for lifting and rope climbs. Not so great for running. My previous Metcon 5s were a little better all around CrossFit shoe. I will definitely wear different shoes for workouts with any amount of running.,1
352,"First pair of workout sneakers, Major difference from non workout footwear. Increased balanced was the first significant noticeable change. Second was improved form.",0
353,"I wanted to like this shoe. Toe box looked large and I have had success with the fit of previous versions of the Metcon.But this shoe is really heavy, inflexible, and fits like a boat.I can get the stiffness as the goal was for more stability, but the fit is sloppy. Loose on top and no way to really snug it down.It seems to be made for a really high volume foot.",1
354,"I really liked these, until my first workout with kipping HSPU - the outsole completely ripped away from the shoe on the heels, massive build oversight. Never had this happen with the previous few metcons or Nanos. Disappointing.",0
355,"The first workout shoe I feel comfortable in. Can't recommend enough, finally not tearing my heel open like that other brand.",1
356,"Shoe is decent, a bit stiff and uncomfortable, almost like a weight-lifting shoe. The shoe has this big area to protect it from ripping when doing rope climbs, but my shoe actually ripped on the bottom of the shoe on the first rope climb workout I did (7 total rope climbs). The Nike return process isn't great - you send the shoes in at your cost, then you get a voucher for the retail of the shoes",0
357,I bought this as my first gym shoe and it has not disappointed. I previously used normal trainers and could feel the difference. It gave me a good solid base for my deadlifts and squats. I wouldn’t recommend for long runs but it is good for running as a warm up on the treadmill before a work out,0
358,Absolutely love these . I’ve had Metcons previously but these are a definite upgrade . They have the same sturdiness which is great for the gym but are much more comfortable than before meaning they are also great for cardio as well as weight training .,1
359,My first dedicated workout shoe and it makes a ton of difference in my stability when I lift. my feet and body feel so stable and the shoe is super comfortable and stylish at the same time. they really put some features in this shoe to help in the gym I'm a fan now,1

362,"Great shoes for CrossFit and gym training, stability is awesome and design is stunning. however, the sole is ripping off on the first wear on both the shoes at the same corner looks like a manufacturing defect.",1
363,Owned a few Metcons in the past and the quality wasn’t there including what it was supposed to do - ie stability and comfort - the holy grail of getting both right. The 9 AMP changed all of that. It’s probably the best shoe I have ever used and meets all the criteria’s set out by NIKE. All I ask for NIKE is please produce more colours!,1
364,"Feel great, better fit than previous model. However, they are too hot, they don’t breathe all that well.",1
365,Huge improvement in comfort and stability with more room for the toes. I will be buying another pair.,1
366,"I've got over 30 Metcons in my CF arsenal, starting since the 4s.  The Metcon 9 is by far the BEST trainer of all time.  Why?  Because it's wider overall base and forefoot creates more stability when preforming functional fitness movements, which gives the athlete confidence to push up the intensity during the WOD.  The cushioning feels softer than the 7 or 8s, which is a good thing, but it",1
367,The improvement of the shoes are significant with stability and with a wider toebox to take a better grip with the toes for cleans and snatches. Running and cardio workouts are a  more comfortable.,1
368,"I’ve owned previous generations of Metcons and these are the best ones yet. Even though they have a slightly higher profile, they feel incredibly stable and firm. These are as good as it gets for squatting and heavy lifting, without buying powerlifting shoes. Love the new flap for hiding the shoe laces and I would, overall, just highlight the high quality build of this shoe.",1
369,"Right out of the gate I love the design of this shoe, really modern and sleek. They’re great for the gym. Super comfortable, breathable and offer great stability during workouts. But they’re also great for all day wear. Found myself wearing them while running errands and they felt really nice, cool and lightweight. All around these are awesome shoes that I’d recommend to anyone.",1
370,Wider toe box is game changer 🔥 comfortable and you feel better the power of the foots,1
371,The shoes are attractive. I received multiple unsolicited comments about how cool they looked. I have a wide foot and these shoes felt very accommodating. They are somewhat stiff with less padding than I would have preferred on the sides and bottom- could probably benefit from a gel insert.  The rubber on the sole of the shoe felt a little stiff and was a little noisier on hard surfaces than a,1
372,"My husband wore these to the gym for his workout and he felt that while they were durable and high quality, the shoes felt heavy on his feet. They felt comfortable while he was walking around but they sounded loud and he didn't like running in them. He said there didn't seem to be much shock absorption.",0
373,"When I first received them, I couldn't wait to try them on! I have been searching to find a good fit cross trainer for my weight training workouts, and these shoes are just right! They slide on very easily, and are very comfortable and fit true to size. I have used them several times and they are so comfy and provide amazing support during my personal training sessions and weight training workouts! I highly recommend these!",1
374,"I am primarily a runner (3-5 runs/10 miles per week) who is looking to get in some additional at-home cardio and strength training, and needed a solid shoe to help get me through backyard and basement workouts (primarily HIIT). The Nike Metcon 9 fit the bill. I expect a lot out of my shoes, and sometimes struggle to find something that balances comfort with strength. After a few weeks wearing",1
375,"I actually love these shoes for comfort and style. I am by no means a CrossFit person, but still really like wearing these for all day wear to make sure I'm comfortable and don't have to worry about my feet aching after doing a lot of walking. I'm a Midwest mom and even taking my kids to the county fairs my feet felt fine the whole time -- if you know, you know.",1
376,These shoes are solid and have a sleek look. They are breathable and have a comfortable design. They are versatile and can be used for everyday wear as well as the gym. They don’t have as much arch support as other shoes I have worn but are still a great pair of shoes. The only thing I would recommend is not covering up the Nike logo as much.,1
377,"My job requires me to be on my feet all day and run back and forth from one end of a building to the other. I usually peel off my shoes at the end of the day and rest my aching feet. These shoes are quite the game changer. I spent all day with them on, cycled home, and went for a run with little discomfort. They appear to be well made and durable, so we will have to see how long I take to run them",1
378,"Imagine our delight when we opened the box and saw the ""cool as fudge"" Metcons staring back at us. The whole family gathered to ooh and ahh over the shoes. My husband wore them around the house, said they felt very comfortable and looked so stylish. According to my husband, they're flat enough to feel comfortable while lifting weights and have some support for jumps, etc. Keep coming up with interesting new shoes Nike!",0

I noticed a lot of work out video instructors wear these and now I know why!  I don't think they run wide, but there is a little extra room on the top of one part of my foot. So far it has not been a problem or felt loose. Super comfy to wear and love the bright blue. Good quality shoe.",1
385,Perfect for my husband's feet. He loves them and wears them almost every day.,1
386,Great shoe! But I noticed its a tad wider around my foot arc area than the previous generation Metcon 5 which I have 3 pair. I have a narrow foot so I have to wear 2 pair of socks when I use these.,1

The 4 and 5 are pretty good, but this one (6) you don’t get the stability or the support for workout, they feel like you are walking on sponges. This one is more like a running shoe than a workout one. Not the same as the ones before. I had to return them.",0

The sole feels more flexible and the heel feels even more cushioned than a previous version I had. These updates were clutch for burpees and box jumps!

552,"Just bought this pair and love them , use them in the gym and they are just made for that. Great quality 👌🏾",1
553,"The best purchase I ever made from Nike! These are so good, and the quality is top-notch. I would never wear these in the gym; they look so clean!",1
554,"Great lifting sneakers, especially if you have difficulty getting into deep squats. great stability, and very comfortable",1
555,Awesome shoes. You need to break them might be a little tight for a person with a wide foot but awesome awesome shoes. Love them,1
556,Order a larger than normal size. Im a 13 and I ordered a 14 based off of other reviews. Sturdy and I feel like I have a stronger base. This shoe is definitely going to help my squat form and base. Super steady heel that will not rock side to side during leg workouts. Love this shoe.,1
557,"These shoes are very comfortable,  provide incredible stability for any weightlifting workout, and look great on the gym floor.  I am very pleased and satisfied, and recommend them highly if you are looking for a weightlifting shoe.",1
558,"I love it. Comfortable, light. and sturdy.",1
559,"Shoes are super cute, definitely make sure to order a half-size up. However they had no shoe tree protectors inside and they creased almost instantly  so that kinda sucked considering how much they were.",1
560,Love the stability given by these. Didn't anticipate the impact these had on my Olympic lifting. Go up half a size,1
561,Nice trainers and beautiful on design,1
562,Perfect shoe for the gym. Great stability and cushion. Only drawback is the toe-box whatever size you normally wear you should go up a 1/2 size for it to be truly comfortable fit (if only I knew). But the shoe definitely turn heads and is meant for true workout animals.,1
563,"Do not listen to the previous reviews about sizing. Everybody saying to buy a size bigger. You will just end up with shoes that are too big, like me.",0
564,These were great looking and looks durable but you definitely need to size up.. I read the comments and someone recommended to size 1/2 up. I did but it was still too small...so i would say go a 1 full size up!,0
565,Great,1
566,Quality seemed ok but they are waaaaayyyy to tight! Order half size up! Not sure if that would have helped with the wideness but my pinky toe was suffocating. Returning these for the Romaleos 4.,0
567,Excellent stability while standing etc Wouldn’t recommend Running or for lots of movement etc but great for lifting.,1
568,"My Savaleos came in after about a week, and they are extremely firm and well made. My only complaint was mine came with stains on the white shoe structure underneath the heel which is kinda lame, but whatever.",1

591,"I purchased these based on a manufacturing issue on my metcom 8’s. I’ve received 2x brand new pairs and the quality of finish is absolutely terrible. Loose strands, unfinished stitching. Nike used to be an affordable quality brand and has hugely lost its way. Very sad times",0

Fantastic for working and more importantly for me personally since I'm a Certified Personal Trainer and constantly on my feet and on the go, I notice how much lighter they are compared to previous versions. I already have several pairs and will keep getting more because I honestly cannot see how Nike will top any future versions, but I'm sure they may find a way. Definitely worth purchasing 💪🏿",1

Most Nike tennis shoes run a bit short on me, so I went up a half size. I'm glad Nike does this for sizes over 12. There's lots of cushion in the heel. I'm happy that Nike brought in a new white combination bcuz the white selections ways run out early, especially in 12 and",1

618,"Recently received a pair of these for the gym. Love the look and stability. However, they do feel tight and have a narrow toe box even for Nikes. I do not have a particularly wide foot, and have worn Nike footwear of all types (running, baseball, football, basketball, trainers) for years without issue. This is the first pair I've purchased that felt too tight. Would recommend purchasing a half size larger than your normal size.",1
619,"The sizing makes no sense. I got a 10, and my foot wouldn’t fit in the shoe, I went a size up and I now have almost 2 inches of toe room. Please figure out your quality control this is a joke. And you don’t have these in stores so I can’t just try on a pair.",0

After wearing the wrong shoes for HIIT classes for so long (running shoes), I finally found the golden pair that helps enhance my fitness technique and doesn’t hurt my feet. They fit like a glove. I have to say that I had to go a half a size up than my regular size to get maximum toe box width and comfort. The mica green combo get so many compliments! The white ones are just as fantastic too!",1

649,"This really is a perfect blend of stability, comfort and flexibility for indoor weightlifting and cardio.  There is meaningful side support for lunging, a wide rear heel to support balance and heavy weights, and a Nike free sole up front for nimble foot movements.   The shoe is very comfortable, comes in many colors and looks great.   This version 5 of the Nike Free Metcon is the best version yet, and preceded by versions 4 and 3.  I own 7+ plus pairs.

657,I wanted something for running and training. I thought it will have enough cushion like all my other Nike shoes but the base on this one is not the best which is unlike Nike. My honest opinion,1
658,These are far more comfortable and flexible than other Metcon Free sneakers.,1
659,I’m not one to write reviews but I bought my first pair of these in July 2023 and after a month of having them I’ve bought a second pair. The most comfortable stable workout shoe I’ve EVER own. I’m 6’1 210 and do CrossFit the size 11 fits perfect. I’ve ran in these and lifted in them they do everything in between. Nike hit a homerun with these shoes .,1

704,Time I put these shoes on they immediately felt good!!  They are very springy/spongy right at the area of your arch!!!  1st pair of shoes I’ve put in in a while that I had that immediate reaction of “I Love These!”  And I’ve worn several pairs recently that just haven’t “done” it for me like Brooks & some On styles!  I’ll definitely be ordering another pair of these Nike Motiva’s in another color!!!,1
705,"Very comfortable, great walking shoes",1
706,I LOVE the Nike Motiva walking shoes!! I'm on my feet ALOT at work and they feel like I'm walking on a cloud. I love the design of the shoe and the many colors they come in!!! I normally wear a 7.5 in Nikes but since they run a little big I got them in a size 7.NIKE DO NOT STOP MAKING THESE AND DO NOT CHANGE THE DESIGN!!,0
707,"These are very comfortable walking shoes. I was not sure how well they would work for me, as Nike shoes tend to be a bit too narrow for my feet, but these were highly recommended so took a chance and ordered online. I tend to be between a 6 and a 6.5, ordered the 6.5 and it fits very well.",1
708,My wife loves this shoe! She bought it and worked out in it and came back all smiles! The cushion was perfect for the balls of her feet and the cylindrical design of the sole made the push and rock motion super easy…,1
709,My favorite work shoe. I’m standing for 9+ hrs a day and these are holding up very well. They are so comfortable. I am normally a size 5 but these fit more comfortably in a size 6.,1
710,The most comfortable and good looking shoes ever,1
711,"Very comfortable. Fits extremely true to size + wide, no need to size up as you may have to do with most running shoes, especially if you intend to use insoles. I sized up as I did with the wildhorse and experienced significant heel slippage, even with insoles. I returned and sized down 1/2 a size.",1
712,"Ordered these at the end of June for work, where I am on my feet walking around for 40+ hrs/wk on concrete and walk an average of about 8-10 miles per day. They were super comfortable and I never had any foot pain, however by September I had completely worn through the bottoms of them. At this price point, I had hoped they would last me much longer, but I would order them again if I needed a pair of casual walking shoes.",1
713,"These shoes are super comfortable at first try on and I love the rocker sole, very bouncy. I have a medium to wide foot and the toe box fit perfectly. The only thing is that they were a bit too short. I wear a women's 8 in regular shoes and usually an 8.5 in running / walking shoes and I have to exchange these for a 9.",1
714,I love this shoe! They feel great they look great. My walking pace increased with these shoes. Nike please drop more colorways in size 14 or drop the Motiva 2.,1
715,One of the best comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I don't feel tired anymore.Context: I walk for 8 hours straight at work,1
716,Absolutely love them. I have wide feet and plantar fasciitis and was struggling in my sketchers slip ins and these feel like they were made for me. They are super comfortable. I'm usually an 8 but went to a size 8.5 and they are perfect 👌,1
717,"I work as a RN in the Emergency Department, 6”1 and 260lbs and these shoes are golden for my 12hrs shift!",1
718,"The Motivas are great for my walking regimen. The big, thick soles make me feel like I'm walking on air instead of concrete and they propel me foward so that I complete my walk in about half the time. This also allows me to walk further.As to comfort, I don't know if I'd walk around in these all day, but for my walks - 2.5 to 4 miles - they are great.The reason I'm abandoning my",1
719,"These are the most comfortable shoes I own, I highly recommend them.",1
720,"These shoes surprised me honestly. I usually wear running shoes or hiking shoes for long walks, but the extra cushion and rocker sole shape make these the best I’ve ever worn for walks exceeding a couple miles.",1
721,"I’ve had these shoes during my military training and I can attest that these are the most plush, most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. Not even HOKAs can match this level of plushiness. Truly one of my best investments, since I felt I could run for miles upon miles with these things. If only I could have gotten the hot pink ones, because I bought the white/light purple ones; it’s a shame",1
722,"I have 2 pairs of these, I am on my feet all day on hard concrete. If I wear any other pair of sneakers to work my legs ache, my feet hurt and I'm miserable. Took a chance bought a pair on sale then got extra 25% and paid $58 , I wish I had bought 2 pair. I get off my legs don't hurt and I don't feel so exhausted. I highly recommend if your on your feet all day these are the ones. Thank you Nike!!",1
723,"I am a 60 year old, and these shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. These shoes bounce you up with every step!  You can walk forever in these shoes!  They actually bounce you to your next step. I am walking faster and no foot pain at all!  Love Nike❤️",1
724,Definitely different.  There is good arch support.  I like the look of them too.,1
725,"Very comfortable, very well cushioned. I wear these to walk several miles each day and I'm very happy with the feel. Good price and good look. I wear a 7 1/2 shoe and I ordered the 7 1/2. I might have been able to go up half a size, but I'm satisfied with the 7 1/2.",1
726,"Amazing walking shoe! Best I’ve ever used, perfect for walking on city streets with all day comfort.",1
727,Best Walking Shoe Ever. I enjoy walking inside and out. These shoes are perfect and extremely comfortable. Don't wait they are worth it. You will not regret it.,1
728,"This is one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I'm a registered nurse and work 12 hour shifts. The hallways are long and my feet take a beating. I worn these to work and my feet did not hurt when I got home, but this shoe is not stylish or cute. Your foot sort of spreads out and the shoe looks huge.",1

731,"Super comfortable. Nice fit, just snug at the heel with good toe room.",1
732,I’m an ICU nurse and these are perfect for being on your feet. The traction is excellent too on slippery surfaces. They fit my custom orthotics perfectly. I highly recommend. (I size up by half a size for Nike as compared to other shoe brands.),1
733,"I’m a nurse that walks 10000+ steps on concrete floors every shift and these shoes absorb every one of those steps! My last 2 pairs were Hokas and I loved the shock absorbing soles but both pairs had issues   (Hoka customer service replaced them with no issues), so I  wasn’t sold on the durability.

I researched which shoes were recommended for walking specifically and saw these come up multiple times, so I gave them a shot. I am so happy I did! My hip pain has almost vanished after only using them for a couple weeks, and I feel so much better! I would recommend these to anyone who walks for fun or",1
737,"Looks really great, design-wise, fits very different. This show runs reeeally small, I had already ordered half a size bigger than my usual size as the reviews recommended this, was still way too small. Also this shoe is more for (very) narrow feet. Walking was very awkward, I felt like walking in those wood sandals, was not a smooth rolling of the sole. When you need to use orthopedic",1

I bought the black ones, love them came for another but the color choices could be better :( still giving 5 stars for comfort. I should take out 2 stars for color. Once u feel these pillows under ur feet, u will never look at ur other uncomfy shoes again. I wish I had these pregnant.",0
743,Very comfy and supportive for walking. I went up half a size after reading reviews and would recommend this. Would love to see them in all black with a black sole too!,1
744,"Im usually hesitant to rave about a shoe. I have flat feet and when on my feet for a long duration they tent to cramp and hurt. I go these shoes on vacation in NYC. I wore these throughout the city.  They feel as if you’re on a rocking cloud. I love these shoes, so much I got a second pair.",1

747,"These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I’m a server in a busy restaurant, and even after 12 hours on my feet I can’t feel the effects at all. They’re very cushioned and bouncy, and it’s like walking on air. I highly recommend for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet.",1
748,Purchased these shoes for a New York trip… I was instantly surprised how comfortable these felt from the moment I put them on! Great shoe for vacation when there’s a lot of walking involved…,1
749,"Overall shoes are great, look an fit wise. I do think there needs to be more cushion under the toe area. Walking while putting your heal down first an rolling the shoe tords your toes has a great feeling on my knees now that im in my late 40's. But my stride ends with pushing off of my toes, so a little more cushion would have been nice.",1
750,Very comfortable and I get a lot of compliments. Perfect work shoes for my long shifts. They are a little loud when walking ( due to the cushioning). But 10/10. I want to buy a 2nd pair in a different color.,1

My feet feel like walking on a marshmallow/ cloud and I love the rocker on this that propels you forward. I can walk longer and I have absolutely no pain in my knees, joints or feet afterwards.

761,Nice quality nice for every day use,1

I own the Motiva and the Nike Invincible 3. I love them both. They feel similar, like walking on a cloud or a marshmallow. I use this shoe for walking mostly. I average 10,000 steps per day. I used them in Tokyo for 4",1

771,"So comfy. Fit true to my Nike size 10 as ever. I have previously used running trainers for my walking (just pavements / paths to get my steps in!), but these are superior. The emphasis is the rocker and cushioned heel makes it like walking on cloud - and they don’t have the same support / restriction that running trainers do. So this makes them more comfortable and breathable. Not sure how they’d hold up off-road, as they are great looking too!",1

When I first put them on I was shocked!!",1
775,"I’m a lifelong Nike brand user. So happy they have finally given us a true “walking” shoe. I am a power walker and absolutely love these shoes. Very comfortable right out of the box. Color choices are also very pleasing. Nike nailed it with these shoes. Just fyi, I wear a 9 in street shoes but always wear a 10 in Nike.  Thank you! 😊",1

847,작년에 재고없어서 리복으로 대체해서 신다가 이번에 재고들어온거 보고 바로 질렀습니다. 디자인부터가 마음에 드는데 리복꺼보다 가볍고 발이 편해서 장시간 운동시에도 발이 아프지가 않네요.,1
848,보통 나이키 신을때는 270으로 신는데 풋살화나 역도화는 반업이 딱 좋습니다디자인은 그냥 끝,0

856,타 브랜드보다 가격대가 있어서 구매를 망설이다 결국 했는데 후회없습니다. 다음에도 역도화가 필요하다면 같은 모델이나 나이키 다른 모델로 구매하려합니다!,1
857,디자인은 말할것도 없구요! 사이즈는 반업 해야한다는 후기가 많아서 정사이즈를 가야하나 반업을 해야하나 고민을 엄청나게 했는데 저는 발볼이 얇은편도 넓은편도 아니라 정사이즈로 갔는데 딱 맞고 좋습니다!,1

964,"I love the looks of the shoe and how stable the heel fits. The hyperlift piece gives me a secure feeling while performing the exercises. My only complaint is the fit and the lockdown. I think the shoe would do great with an additional laceloop to fit the heel better. In regards to the toebox, it feels rather spacious, a bit too much really, but I would not size down because then the midfoot would",1
965,"Very cool style ,but color was misleading. Definitely not neon green like we hoped. It was more highliter yellow.",1

It felt somewhat uncomfortable when I put them on yet when I started to realize the support it gave me when I worked out, I immediately changed my view of this shoe.

989,Excellent product ! very happy and perfect for the gym,1
990,"I have few regrets in life... But one is definitely that I did not buy more pairs of the Metcon 6s. The 7s were a step backward, and these 8s are just a train wreck.

They don't rub or cause any painful spots and it's easy to keep my laces up and out of the way during my workouts.",1
1003,Started getting back into my routine of working out and needed a shoe with good support for cross training. The shoe felt great from the moment I put it on.

I wore them every single day and most evenings as I went on my excusions.  I did over 10,000 steps everyday and not once can I say that my feet hurt.

1131,좀 딱딱하긴한데 운동할때 딱 좋아요,1

1133,크로스핏으로 아주 좋습니다👏👏,1
1134,"발볼이 넓어서 보통 280 신었는데 나이키는 반업도 아닌 한 업해서 290신어야 발가락 간섭이 없더라고요. 대신에 신발끈을 꽉 조여서 뒤꿈치 덜렁거리지 않게 해야했고요. 바닥에 딱 달라붙는 느낌이 좋네요. 서 있을 때 안정감이 좋습니다. 러닝화는 쿠션이 좋아서 발목이 불안불안 하다면 요건 웨이트 하라고 만든것 같습니다. 비교로 줌메트콘 터보도 신어봤는데 이게 훨씬 안정감이 느껴집니다. 명동매장에 다행이 모델별로 비교해서 신어보고 결정하니 배송, 반품에 시간낭비가 줄어서 좋습니다. 직원들도 정말 친절하세요.",1

1137,다른 운동화랑 비교했을때 길이는 비슷하나 폭이 조금 좁아서 발볼이 넓거나 조금 여유롭게 신고싶으면 반업 하시는게 좋을거 같습니다. 메트콘이라 확실히 가볍고 바닥은 앞쪽은 얇고 뒤꿈치쪽은 두꺼운게 확실하게 느껴집니다.,1
1138,사이즈 팁 드리자면 저는 발볼 약간 있고나이키 신발들은 260신는데 메트콘6 같은 경우에는 반업 해서 265 신고 있었습니다.이번 메트콘9도 양말도 신고 생각보다잘 늘어날거 같지 않아서 반업해서 265 구입하였는데딱 잘 맞는것 같습니다.,1
1139,오늘 제품을 받자마자 바로 신어보았습니다. 처음에 신을때 발이 들어갈땐 약간 불편하다?끼는 느낌인데 딱 들어가는 순간 편안함을 제공해주네요 전 발볼이 조금 있는편이라 나이키는 농구화 일반화 모두 반업해서 신어요 275인데 나이키는 다 280입니다 이 신발도 반업해서 신었는데 앞쪽이 살짝 남지만 크게 문제가 되진 않아요 앞쪽이 남는다고 발볼 있으신분들 정사이즈 가시면 약간 불편할수도 있을듯하네요 운동양말 신고 신으면 딱 맞아요 모두 이 신발 신고 득근하세요,1
1140,"Within 1 month, the sole had worn through to the plastic “lift wedge” in the heel. Now when I walk/run there is an annoying “click/tap” sound from the plastic hitting the concrete or asphalt. Within 6 weeks, the interior liner in the counter/heel cup had worn through. Very underwhelming durability for a “training” shoe. Especially when previous Metcon models were very well made.",1
1141,Comfortable im enjoying them very much,1
1142,Love the shoes. Wider fit which is hard to find. Will definitely order again.,1
1143,I love the shoes that I bought.,1
1144,Stylish working out trainer. Nicely sized and comfortable Well priced,1
1145,I Usually get the metcons  for training because I CrossFit but the style has changed they are bulkier and heavier the look is wider as well so it makes the foot appear bigger. This was my 4th pair  and sadly I’ll be returning these. I need something lightweight that’s still good for lifting,1
1146,Extremely Uncomfortable had to return,0
1147,"These simply do not hold up. They are extremely comfortable, which is why I gave them a two instead of a one. The outer sole wears away on the heal very easily. Once that is gone it sounds like you’re wearing tap shoes every time you take a step. Nike needs to fix this design flaw in the next version.",1
1148,Very nice fitting shoe true to size,1
1149,The shoe is extremely comfortable and arrived remarkably quickly.,1
1150,I sprained my ankle in previous Metcon's... So I bought these Metcon 9's specifically for the stability and I love them! I stress tested my ankle in them for months and I cannot see an easy to sprain my ankle again. The stability and stiffness of the materials does create more noise while walking but it's worth it.,1
1151,My son said these are very good shoes for his football workouts. They are comfortable and work for lifting and running.,1

1153,Cool colorway. Great price. Quick delivery,1
1154,Goid shoeStylishComfortable Loved the color,1
1155,Wish you could make the back half of the bottom sole longer so your heel is above the toes. In a nut shell bigger rubber on back half of sole,0
1156,"Looks good, great fit and very comfortable. So glad I bought them",1
1157,"Very comfortable gym shoes. I love it. When working out in the gym, people were asking were I bought it from.",1
1158,Loved the look but the rubber wears out quickly on the heel and you become a tap dancer! Plastic contact on pavement is loud! Had to throw them away,0
1159,I purchased the metcon 9 over the 8 due to price and availability so we will see how these hold up. Originally bought two pair of the metcon 8's each lasting six months before a hole would form in the middle front and the material on the heel started to come off. Also the 8's had an issue of the sole separating from the shoe in the front so I wanted to give the 9's a chance to see if they hold up,0
1160,"Fit is as good as the 8s, which were the best fitting metcons that I’ve had.  Price was great on this color and was why I",1
1161,Good materials. Ran a little big,1
1162,Improved over my Metcon 7’s. Better for short runs. But toe box is much roomier-may want to order half size smaller. Shoes also feel a little hot during tough workouts.,1
1163,Bought twice and both have had the same issue with a part of the sole coming lose within 6-8 weeks. Nike will refund you but it’s not a straight forward process. Would not recommend if you do crossfit.,0
1164,Glad I decided to splurge on these. Have been needing a new pair of gym shoes for a while! Can’t go wrong with a pair of metcons! Wish they would’ve had the free metcons in the store bud very happy with these!,1
1165,"Great solid shoe for cross training, great stability for weight lifting but feel a little bulky to run in. They look great too!",1
1166,BEST WORKOUT SHOE EVER !! FOR MY STRENGHT TRAINING,1

1168,"Aesthetics RULE! And, when it comes “Aesthetics.” NiKE’s are KiNG! The COMFORT & FEEL, for GyM LiFE MOVEMENTS, are “GRADE A STANDARD.” I Love Them.",1
1169,Exceptional stability and comfort for those that have mixed workout style. I have tried the variety of cross training / functional style shoes and so far the metcons gym stability and fit for movement is the strongest.,1
1170,"Definitely stable shoes for lunges and squats which is what I am doing. Took them on a 4 mile walk and I could definitely tell I should of used other shoes.I like the look, feel and support. Exactly what I needed.",1
1171,"Overall look is pretty cool. Overall feel and quality is horrible. Sides are so stiff it's bruising the underside of my ankle bone. Within a month not even working out in them, the rubber is coming off in chunks just leaving plastic at the very back of heel. When I'm walking there's a plastic noise hitting the floor with every step which is super annoying. Overall I hate them and do not wear them anymore.",0
1172,"Physical Therapist here. Been wearing these for about 4 months now, for both lifting and work. I have to say they are one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn in a minute. As someone who talks/recommends shoes on the regular, this is the first shoe Nike that I will endorse. As a size 14 with a bunion and very picky, these have met all my expectations and I will be buying a pair in white. Cheers y'all.",1
1173,I am very pleased with the trainers. Look good and perform really well in training. Had to go down a half size for the fitting. Also bought the Air Alpha’s in the matching colours.,1
1174,"Still only a few weeks old and they're good for the gym floor, especially for things like back weight squats, deadlifts etc where I've taken my trainers off in the past for. Only slight niggle is the top of the shoe around the lower ankle is quite rigid but I'm guessing that will ease after some more use.",1
1175,"I've noticed that Nike's recycled components shoes tend to be incredibly uncomfortable with very little give. This shoe was almost great, but the plastic that wraps around the side pulls very uncomfortably and does not allow for natural foot movements.",0
1176,"First time wearing CrossFit trainers , absolutely love them they make such a difference to stability when lifting.",1
1177,I love them the delivery was spot on everything was perfect,1
1178,Best training shoe I’ve worn. Comfortable for walking and cardio training as well.,1
1179,I was disappointed. Felt so heavy and slippery on tiles.,0
1180,"These are great lifting shoes. They are sturdy, comfortable and look great on the feet.",1
1181,"Overall a good shoe. They fit wider than most Nikes I’ve tried on in the past. My foot isn’t wide enough for a wide EE shoe, but most Nikes strangle my foot so these are a perfect fit for me. They are a little loud and clunky to run in but that’s not what they’re intended for so it’s not that big of a deal. Would have given it 5 stars but for $150 the quality control is lacking . I got the black and grey ones and there’s visible glue all over the shoe.",1
1182,Sole delaminating from plate on heel after only 3 months.,0
1183,I absolutely love these. It’s the best Meton evolution ever. This is my second pair that I bought within 30 days. Love them for working out CrossFit Pickleball. It’s a great all around shoe,1
1184,Good shoes ....nice to wear...fit size color amazing...,1
1185,"Honestly, thee best Metcon so far. Admittedly, I found these awful and plain looking initially. After finally purchasing, I was silenced when I realized the true quality of this shoe. Heavy lifts, circuits, and daily use; this model has covered it all. Smooth while walking and handling daily tasks, yet sturdy for crossfit, but grounded for compound movements. The amount of detail that has gone",0
1186,"Really wish they would go back to the Metcon 5 style.. every year these get bulkier, heavier and stiffer. These have wayyy to much padding around the shoe and it feels thick and heavy. Definitely can’t do any running in these. I’ve owned many pairs of the metcons and these are by far the worst.",0
1187,Fits true to size and very comfortable. Love how stable they are when doing squats. Feels great to lift in.,1
1188,"Very nice and stylish 😎 I really love it,it's comfortable",1
1189,Design is so much uglier than the Metcon 8. Please re-evaulate your design process. If I could return order for the nike ID custom design Metcon 8's I would.,0
1190,I love these shoes...they are super comfortable and they look awesome.,1
1191,Great shoes.  Fit well.  Work well when doing my Hiit exercise.,1
1192,"Oof where to start. First they are not a good looking shoe (I was hoping the feel and functionality would help overlook this and just never looking down). Second, this thing feels like a boot. If you like Metcon 6s, Nano 2.0, or Nano 4.0 you're probably going to hate these shoes as I do. Third, the middle sole is carved out for the rope rubber and it makes them feel less stable for lifting because",0
1193,"I love these shoes! Perfect for every aspect of my gym workout! Plenty of support, and fit comfortably.",1
1194,So far my favorite Metcon.  Perfect in the gym and not as clunky as the previous model for short runs. They feel extremely light on your feet.,1
1195,"Great shoe, amazing for any lift or form of weightlifting",1
1196,"Excellent, they are super comfortable and do not bother you when lifting weights",1
1197,Love these shoes for deadlifts and squats. They fit great . Look great!,1
1198,"Comfortably , good material ten stars",1
1199,"I love it, everything was perfect on time",1
1200,This is my 4th version of Metcons and I can confidently say this is by far the best Metcon. The toe box is slightly wider than previous versions and the upper is much more flexible for more cardio workouts.,1
1201,"Good lifting shoes, but the Metcon’s get uglier every year, with worse integration of the rope guard. It’s now just a giant chunk of rubber glued on the side. The 4s were so much nicer looking. Just reissue those.",0
1202,Great for lifting and rope climbs. Not so great for running. My previous Metcon 5s were a little better all around CrossFit shoe. I will definitely wear different shoes for workouts with any amount of running.,1
1203,"First pair of workout sneakers, Major difference from non workout footwear. Increased balanced was the first significant noticeable change. Second was improved form.",0
1204,"I wanted to like this shoe. Toe box looked large and I have had success with the fit of previous versions of the Metcon.But this shoe is really heavy, inflexible, and fits like a boat.I can get the stiffness as the goal was for more stability, but the fit is sloppy. Loose on top and no way to really snug it down.It seems to be made for a really high volume foot.",1
1205,"I really liked these, until my first workout with kipping HSPU - the outsole completely ripped away from the shoe on the heels, massive build oversight. Never had this happen with the previous few metcons or Nanos. Disappointing.",0
1206,"The first workout shoe I feel comfortable in. Can't recommend enough, finally not tearing my heel open like that other brand.",1
1207,"Shoe is decent, a bit stiff and uncomfortable, almost like a weight-lifting shoe. The shoe has this big area to protect it from ripping when doing rope climbs, but my shoe actually ripped on the bottom of the shoe on the first rope climb workout I did (7 total rope climbs). The Nike return process isn't great - you send the shoes in at your cost, then you get a voucher for the retail of the shoes",0
1208,I bought this as my first gym shoe and it has not disappointed. I previously used normal trainers and could feel the difference. It gave me a good solid base for my deadlifts and squats. I wouldn’t recommend for long runs but it is good for running as a warm up on the treadmill before a work out,0
1209,Absolutely love these . I’ve had Metcons previously but these are a definite upgrade . They have the same sturdiness which is great for the gym but are much more comfortable than before meaning they are also great for cardio as well as weight training .,1
1210,My first dedicated workout shoe and it makes a ton of difference in my stability when I lift. my feet and body feel so stable and the shoe is super comfortable and stylish at the same time. they really put some features in this shoe to help in the gym I'm a fan now,1

1213,"Great shoes for CrossFit and gym training, stability is awesome and design is stunning. however, the sole is ripping off on the first wear on both the shoes at the same corner looks like a manufacturing defect.",1
1214,Owned a few Metcons in the past and the quality wasn’t there including what it was supposed to do - ie stability and comfort - the holy grail of getting both right. The 9 AMP changed all of that. It’s probably the best shoe I have ever used and meets all the criteria’s set out by NIKE. All I ask for NIKE is please produce more colours!,1
1215,"Feel great, better fit than previous model. However, they are too hot, they don’t breathe all that well.",1
1216,Huge improvement in comfort and stability with more room for the toes. I will be buying another pair.,1
1217,"I've got over 30 Metcons in my CF arsenal, starting since the 4s.  The Metcon 9 is by far the BEST trainer of all time.  Why?  Because it's wider overall base and forefoot creates more stability when preforming functional fitness movements, which gives the athlete confidence to push up the intensity during the WOD.  The cushioning feels softer than the 7 or 8s, which is a good thing, but it",1
1218,The improvement of the shoes are significant with stability and with a wider toebox to take a better grip with the toes for cleans and snatches. Running and cardio workouts are a  more comfortable.,1
1219,"I’ve owned previous generations of Metcons and these are the best ones yet. Even though they have a slightly higher profile, they feel incredibly stable and firm. These are as good as it gets for squatting and heavy lifting, without buying powerlifting shoes. Love the new flap for hiding the shoe laces and I would, overall, just highlight the high quality build of this shoe.",1
1220,"Right out of the gate I love the design of this shoe, really modern and sleek. They’re great for the gym. Super comfortable, breathable and offer great stability during workouts. But they’re also great for all day wear. Found myself wearing them while running errands and they felt really nice, cool and lightweight. All around these are awesome shoes that I’d recommend to anyone.",1
1221,Wider toe box is game changer 🔥 comfortable and you feel better the power of the foots,1
1222,The shoes are attractive. I received multiple unsolicited comments about how cool they looked. I have a wide foot and these shoes felt very accommodating. They are somewhat stiff with less padding than I would have preferred on the sides and bottom- could probably benefit from a gel insert.  The rubber on the sole of the shoe felt a little stiff and was a little noisier on hard surfaces than a,1
1223,"My husband wore these to the gym for his workout and he felt that while they were durable and high quality, the shoes felt heavy on his feet. They felt comfortable while he was walking around but they sounded loud and he didn't like running in them. He said there didn't seem to be much shock absorption.",0
1224,"When I first received them, I couldn't wait to try them on! I have been searching to find a good fit cross trainer for my weight training workouts, and these shoes are just right! They slide on very easily, and are very comfortable and fit true to size. I have used them several times and they are so comfy and provide amazing support during my personal training sessions and weight training workouts! I highly recommend these!",1
1225,"I am primarily a runner (3-5 runs/10 miles per week) who is looking to get in some additional at-home cardio and strength training, and needed a solid shoe to help get me through backyard and basement workouts (primarily HIIT). The Nike Metcon 9 fit the bill. I expect a lot out of my shoes, and sometimes struggle to find something that balances comfort with strength. After a few weeks wearing",1
1226,"I actually love these shoes for comfort and style. I am by no means a CrossFit person, but still really like wearing these for all day wear to make sure I'm comfortable and don't have to worry about my feet aching after doing a lot of walking. I'm a Midwest mom and even taking my kids to the county fairs my feet felt fine the whole time -- if you know, you know.",1
1227,These shoes are solid and have a sleek look. They are breathable and have a comfortable design. They are versatile and can be used for everyday wear as well as the gym. They don’t have as much arch support as other shoes I have worn but are still a great pair of shoes. The only thing I would recommend is not covering up the Nike logo as much.,1
1228,"My job requires me to be on my feet all day and run back and forth from one end of a building to the other. I usually peel off my shoes at the end of the day and rest my aching feet. These shoes are quite the game changer. I spent all day with them on, cycled home, and went for a run with little discomfort. They appear to be well made and durable, so we will have to see how long I take to run them",1
1229,"Imagine our delight when we opened the box and saw the ""cool as fudge"" Metcons staring back at us. The whole family gathered to ooh and ahh over the shoes.

1340,"디자인이 이뻐서 구입했습니다. 나이키는 사이즈가 좀 꽉 끼게 나오는 감이 있어서 265신지만 270으로 주문했고, 신어보니 발을 단단히 잡아줍니다. 솔직히 신다보면 늘어나서 발에 맞춰지기 때문에 정사이즈도 괜찮다고 생각하지만, 그래도 반 업이 더 나은것 같습니다. 에어솔이 있어 쿠션감이 좋고, 가격이 저렴해서 너무 좋습니다. 무엇보다 나이키 로고가 길고 날카롭게 뻗어있는것과 테두리 진한 선이 너무 마음에 듭니다. 솔직히 검, 빨 디자인도 좋았는데 제 평소 복장에는 무리가 있을것 같아 화이트, 블루로 했습니다.",1

1467,다른 운동화랑 비교했을때 길이는 비슷하나 폭이 조금 좁아서 발볼이 넓거나 조금 여유롭게 신고싶으면 반업 하시는게 좋을거 같습니다. 메트콘이라 확실히 가볍고 바닥은 앞쪽은 얇고 뒤꿈치쪽은 두꺼운게 확실하게 느껴집니다.,1
1468,사이즈 팁 드리자면 저는 발볼 약간 있고나이키 신발들은 260신는데 메트콘6 같은 경우에는 반업 해서 265 신고 있었습니다.이번 메트콘9도 양말도 신고 생각보다잘 늘어날거 같지 않아서 반업해서 265 구입하였는데딱 잘 맞는것 같습니다.,1

1470,"Within 1 month, the sole had worn through to the plastic “lift wedge” in the heel. Now when I walk/run there is an annoying “click/tap” sound from the plastic hitting the concrete or asphalt. Within 6 weeks, the interior liner in the counter/heel cup had worn through. Very underwhelming durability for a “training” shoe. Especially when previous Metcon models were very well made.",1
1471,Comfortable im enjoying them very much,1
1472,Love the shoes. Wider fit which is hard to find. Will definitely order again.,1
1473,I love the shoes that I bought.,1

1475,I Usually get the metcons  for training because I CrossFit but the style has changed they are bulkier and heavier the look is wider as well so it makes the foot appear bigger. This was my 4th pair  and sadly I’ll be returning these. I need something lightweight that’s still good for lifting,1
1476,Extremely Uncomfortable had to return,0
1477,"These simply do not hold up. They are extremely comfortable, which is why I gave them a two instead of a one. The outer sole wears away on the heal very easily. Once that is gone it sounds like you’re wearing tap shoes every time you take a step. Nike needs to fix this design flaw in the next version.",1
1478,Very nice fitting shoe true to size,1
1479,The shoe is extremely comfortable and arrived remarkably quickly.,1
1480,I sprained my ankle in previous Metcon's... So I bought these Metcon 9's specifically for the stability and I love them! I stress tested my ankle in them for months and I cannot see an easy to sprain my ankle again. The stability and stiffness of the materials does create more noise while walking but it's worth it.,1
1481,My son said these are very good shoes for his football workouts. They are comfortable and work for lifting and running.,1

1483,Cool colorway. Great price. Quick delivery,1

1485,Wish you could make the back half of the bottom sole longer so your heel is above the toes. In a nut shell bigger rubber on back half of sole,0

1487,"Very comfortable gym shoes. I love it. When working out in the gym, people were asking were I bought it from.",1
1488,Loved the look but the rubber wears out quickly on the heel and you become a tap dancer! Plastic contact on pavement is loud! Had to throw them away,0
1489,I purchased the metcon 9 over the 8 due to price and availability so we will see how these hold up. Originally bought two pair of the metcon 8's each lasting six months before a hole would form in the middle front and the material on the heel started to come off. Also the 8's had an issue of the sole separating from the shoe in the front so I wanted to give the 9's a chance to see if they hold up,0
1490,"Fit is as good as the 8s, which were the best fitting metcons that I’ve had.  Price was great on this color and was why I",1
1491,Good materials. Ran a little big,1
1492,Improved over my Metcon 7’s. Better for short runs. But toe box is much roomier-may want to order half size smaller. Shoes also feel a little hot during tough workouts.,1
1493,Bought twice and both have had the same issue with a part of the sole coming lose within 6-8 weeks. Nike will refund you but it’s not a straight forward process. Would not recommend if you do crossfit.,0
1494,Glad I decided to splurge on these. Have been needing a new pair of gym shoes for a while! Can’t go wrong with a pair of metcons! Wish they would’ve had the free metcons in the store bud very happy with these!,1
1495,"Great solid shoe for cross training, great stability for weight lifting but feel a little bulky to run in. They look great too!",1
1496,BEST WORKOUT SHOE EVER !! FOR MY STRENGHT TRAINING,1
1497,"Good fit was the same fit as the metcon 7, just pay attention to the Women or Men size when u buy them.",0
1498,"Aesthetics RULE! And, when it comes “Aesthetics.” NiKE’s are KiNG! The COMFORT & FEEL, for GyM LiFE MOVEMENTS, are “GRADE A STANDARD.” I Love Them.",1
1499,Exceptional stability and comfort for those that have mixed workout style. I have tried the variety of cross training / functional style shoes and so far the metcons gym stability and fit for movement is the strongest.,1
1500,"Definitely stable shoes for lunges and squats which is what I am doing. Took them on a 4 mile walk and I could definitely tell I should of used other shoes.I like the look, feel and support. Exactly what I needed.",1
1501,"Overall look is pretty cool. Overall feel and quality is horrible. Sides are so stiff it's bruising the underside of my ankle bone. Within a month not even working out in them, the rubber is coming off in chunks just leaving plastic at the very back of heel. When I'm walking there's a plastic noise hitting the floor with every step which is super annoying. Overall I hate them and do not wear them anymore.",0
1502,"Physical Therapist here. Been wearing these for about 4 months now, for both lifting and work. I have to say they are one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn in a minute. As someone who talks/recommends shoes on the regular, this is the first shoe Nike that I will endorse. As a size 14 with a bunion and very picky, these have met all my expectations and I will be buying a pair in white. Cheers y'all.",1
1503,I am very pleased with the trainers. Look good and perform really well in training. Had to go down a half size for the fitting. Also bought the Air Alpha’s in the matching colours.,1
1504,"Still only a few weeks old and they're good for the gym floor, especially for things like back weight squats, deadlifts etc where I've taken my trainers off in the past for. Only slight niggle is the top of the shoe around the lower ankle is quite rigid but I'm guessing that will ease after some more use.",1
1505,"I've noticed that Nike's recycled components shoes tend to be incredibly uncomfortable with very little give. This shoe was almost great, but the plastic that wraps around the side pulls very uncomfortably and does not allow for natural foot movements.",0
1506,"First time wearing CrossFit trainers , absolutely love them they make such a difference to stability when lifting.",1
1507,I love them the delivery was spot on everything was perfect,1
1508,Best training shoe I’ve worn. Comfortable for walking and cardio training as well.,1
1509,I was disappointed. Felt so heavy and slippery on tiles.,0
1510,"These are great lifting shoes. They are sturdy, comfortable and look great on the feet.",1
1511,"Overall a good shoe. They fit wider than most Nikes I’ve tried on in the past. My foot isn’t wide enough for a wide EE shoe, but most Nikes strangle my foot so these are a perfect fit for me. They are a little loud and clunky to run in but that’s not what they’re intended for so it’s not that big of a deal. Would have given it 5 stars but for $150 the quality control is lacking . I got the black and grey ones and there’s visible glue all over the shoe.",1

1513,I absolutely love these. It’s the best Meton evolution ever. This is my second pair that I bought within 30 days. Love them for working out CrossFit Pickleball. It’s a great all around shoe,1
1514,Good shoes ....nice to wear...fit size color amazing...,1
1515,"Honestly, thee best Metcon so far. Admittedly, I found these awful and plain looking initially. After finally purchasing, I was silenced when I realized the true quality of this shoe. Heavy lifts, circuits, and daily use; this model has covered it all. Smooth while walking and handling daily tasks, yet sturdy for crossfit, but grounded for compound movements. The amount of detail that has gone",0
1516,"Really wish they would go back to the Metcon 5 style.. every year these get bulkier, heavier and stiffer. These have wayyy to much padding around the shoe and it feels thick and heavy. Definitely can’t do any running in these. I’ve owned many pairs of the metcons and these are by far the worst.",0
1517,Fits true to size and very comfortable. Love how stable they are when doing squats. Feels great to lift in.,1
1518,"Very nice and stylish 😎 I really love it,it's comfortable",1
1519,Design is so much uglier than the Metcon 8. Please re-evaulate your design process. If I could return order for the nike ID custom design Metcon 8's I would.,0
1520,I love these shoes...they are super comfortable and they look awesome.,1
1521,Great shoes.  Fit well.  Work well when doing my Hiit exercise.,1
1522,"Oof where to start. First they are not a good looking shoe (I was hoping the feel and functionality would help overlook this and just never looking down). Second, this thing feels like a boot. If you like Metcon 6s, Nano 2.0, or Nano 4.0 you're probably going to hate these shoes as I do. Third, the middle sole is carved out for the rope rubber and it makes them feel less stable for lifting because",0
1523,"I love these shoes! Perfect for every aspect of my gym workout! Plenty of support, and fit comfortably.",1
1524,So far my favorite Metcon.  Perfect in the gym and not as clunky as the previous model for short runs. They feel extremely light on your feet.,1

1529,"I love it, everything was perfect on time",1
1530,This is my 4th version of Metcons and I can confidently say this is by far the best Metcon. The toe box is slightly wider than previous versions and the upper is much more flexible for more cardio workouts.,1
1531,"Good lifting shoes, but the Metcon’s get uglier every year, with worse integration of the rope guard. It’s now just a giant chunk of rubber glued on the side. The 4s were so much nicer looking. Just reissue those.",0
1532,Great for lifting and rope climbs. Not so great for running. My previous Metcon 5s were a little better all around CrossFit shoe. I will definitely wear different shoes for workouts with any amount of running.,1

1534,"I wanted to like this shoe. Toe box looked large and I have had success with the fit of previous versions of the Metcon.But this shoe is really heavy, inflexible, and fits like a boat.I can get the stiffness as the goal was for more stability, but the fit is sloppy. Loose on top and no way to really snug it down.It seems to be made for a really high volume foot.",1
1535,"I really liked these, until my first workout with kipping HSPU - the outsole completely ripped away from the shoe on the heels, massive build oversight. Never had this happen with the previous few metcons or Nanos. Disappointing.",0
1536,"The first workout shoe I feel comfortable in. Can't recommend enough, finally not tearing my heel open like that other brand.",1
1537,"Shoe is decent, a bit stiff and uncomfortable, almost like a weight-lifting shoe. The shoe has this big area to protect it from ripping when doing rope climbs, but my shoe actually ripped on the bottom of the shoe on the first rope climb workout I did (7 total rope climbs). The Nike return process isn't great - you send the shoes in at your cost, then you get a voucher for the retail of the shoes",0
1538,I bought this as my first gym shoe and it has not disappointed. I previously used normal trainers and could feel the difference. It gave me a good solid base for my deadlifts and squats. I wouldn’t recommend for long runs but it is good for running as a warm up on the treadmill before a work out,0
1539,Absolutely love these . I’ve had Metcons previously but these are a definite upgrade . They have the same sturdiness which is great for the gym but are much more comfortable than before meaning they are also great for cardio as well as weight training .,1
1540,My first dedicated workout shoe and it makes a ton of difference in my stability when I lift. my feet and body feel so stable and the shoe is super comfortable and stylish at the same time. they really put some features in this shoe to help in the gym I'm a fan now,1

1544,Owned a few Metcons in the past and the quality wasn’t there including what it was supposed to do - ie stability and comfort - the holy grail of getting both right. The 9 AMP changed all of that. It’s probably the best shoe I have ever used and meets all the criteria’s set out by NIKE. All I ask for NIKE is please produce more colours!,1
1545,"Feel great, better fit than previous model. However, they are too hot, they don’t breathe all that well.",1
1546,Huge improvement in comfort and stability with more room for the toes. I will be buying another pair.,1
1547,"I've got over 30 Metcons in my CF arsenal, starting since the 4s.  The Metcon 9 is by far the BEST trainer of all time.  Why?  Because it's wider overall base and forefoot creates more stability when preforming functional fitness movements, which gives the athlete confidence to push up the intensity during the WOD.  The cushioning feels softer than the 7 or 8s, which is a good thing, but it",1
1548,The improvement of the shoes are significant with stability and with a wider toebox to take a better grip with the toes for cleans and snatches. Running and cardio workouts are a  more comfortable.,1
1549,"I’ve owned previous generations of Metcons and these are the best ones yet. Even though they have a slightly higher profile, they feel incredibly stable and firm. These are as good as it gets for squatting and heavy lifting, without buying powerlifting shoes. Love the new flap for hiding the shoe laces and I would, overall, just highlight the high quality build of this shoe.",1
1550,"Right out of the gate I love the design of this shoe, really modern and sleek. They’re great for the gym. Super comfortable, breathable and offer great stability during workouts. But they’re also great for all day wear. Found myself wearing them while running errands and they felt really nice, cool and lightweight. All around these are awesome shoes that I’d recommend to anyone.",1
1551,Wider toe box is game changer 🔥 comfortable and you feel better the power of the foots,1
1552,The shoes are attractive. I received multiple unsolicited comments about how cool they looked. I have a wide foot and these shoes felt very accommodating. They are somewhat stiff with less padding than I would have preferred on the sides and bottom- could probably benefit from a gel insert.  The rubber on the sole of the shoe felt a little stiff and was a little noisier on hard surfaces than a,1
1553,"My husband wore these to the gym for his workout and he felt that while they were durable and high quality, the shoes felt heavy on his feet. They felt comfortable while he was walking around but they sounded loud and he didn't like running in them. He said there didn't seem to be much shock absorption.",0
1554,"When I first received them, I couldn't wait to try them on! I have been searching to find a good fit cross trainer for my weight training workouts, and these shoes are just right! They slide on very easily, and are very comfortable and fit true to size. I have used them several times and they are so comfy and provide amazing support during my personal training sessions and weight training workouts! I highly recommend these!",1
1555,"I am primarily a runner (3-5 runs/10 miles per week) who is looking to get in some additional at-home cardio and strength training, and needed a solid shoe to help get me through backyard and basement workouts (primarily HIIT). The Nike Metcon 9 fit the bill. I expect a lot out of my shoes, and sometimes struggle to find something that balances comfort with strength. After a few weeks wearing",1
1556,"I actually love these shoes for comfort and style. I am by no means a CrossFit person, but still really like wearing these for all day wear to make sure I'm comfortable and don't have to worry about my feet aching after doing a lot of walking. I'm a Midwest mom and even taking my kids to the county fairs my feet felt fine the whole time -- if you know, you know.",1
1557,These shoes are solid and have a sleek look. They are breathable and have a comfortable design. They are versatile and can be used for everyday wear as well as the gym. They don’t have as much arch support as other shoes I have worn but are still a great pair of shoes. The only thing I would recommend is not covering up the Nike logo as much.,1
1558,"My job requires me to be on my feet all day and run back and forth from one end of a building to the other. I usually peel off my shoes at the end of the day and rest my aching feet. These shoes are quite the game changer. I spent all day with them on, cycled home, and went for a run with little discomfort. They appear to be well made and durable, so we will have to see how long I take to run them",1
1559,"Imagine our delight when we opened the box and saw the ""cool as fudge"" Metcons staring back at us. The whole family gathered to ooh and ahh over the shoes.

So far it has not been a problem or felt loose. Super comfy to wear and love the bright blue. Good quality shoe.",1
1566,Perfect for my husband's feet. He loves them and wears them almost every day.,1

1578,"This Metcon are way different from the 4 and 5, the bottom of the shoe feels cheap, is kinda like Nike was trying to make a workout/running shoes at the same time. The 4 and 5 are pretty good, but this one (6) you don’t get the stability or the support for workout, they feel like you are walking on sponges. This one is more like a running shoe than a workout one. Not the same as the ones before. I had to return them.",0

But I do not agree with the decision on using those tiny string-like things to pull the laces through.  They will not stand the test of time like previous versions.  I expect they are trying to cut costs while not cutting,0

The material feels like it won’t last long. Almost looks",0

From lifts, walks, and everything in between I felt comfortable and supported in these beauties! I was able to go from heavy squats to box jumps with no problem and was never uncomfortable during my sessions. These are now a must have for when I hit the gym.",1
1593,"I used these in the gym a few times now. My workouts mainly include weight training and plyometrics. The sole feels more flexible and the heel feels even more cushioned than a previous version I had. These updates were clutch for burpees and box jumps!

1645,우선 초보 핼린이에서 중급으로 넘어가는 사람입니다편한 신발 (러닝화 위주로) 로 신으며 운동을 하니 하체 및 low. back 운동시에 운동화에 쿠션닝이 오히려 운동에 방해가 되더라구요..그래서 평이 좋은 로말 블랙을 겟 했습니다사이즈는 우선 작게 나왔어여 나이키 리액트 265신는데..반업 해서270구매 했어요 . 딱 막는 사이즈 입니다.빈틈없이 딱 맞아서 좋긴 합니다지지력과 고정력은 메트콘 보다 훨씬 좋은거 같아요~,1
1646,평소 발목유연성이 나쁘지는 않았고  다소 부담되는 가격이지만 막상 신어보니 스쿼트할때 도움이 되는것 같네요..평소 왠만한 운동화 260신는데.. 반업하라는 추천이 많아서 265주문했다가 커서 260 으로 재주문했는데 만족합니다.,1
1647,발목가동성에서 일단 너무 편안하고 바닥에 접착제 발라놓은 느낌입니다ㅋㅋㅋ,1
1648,"운동할때 신을꺼라 디자인을 생각안하고 샀지만,막상 운동할때 거울에 비친 역도화 이쁘네요 ㅎㅎ",1
1649,"고중량 스쿼트, 데드리프트시에 발의 고정력과 접지력이 매우 좋습니다.",1
1650,"발목 등 유연성이 떨어져서 벗윙크가 많이 발생했는데, 로말레오 제품 사용하고 많은 도움 받고있습니다.본세트 전에는 착용하지 않고 수행해서 가동범위 훈련을 겸하고, 본세트에서는 로말레오를 착용하여 수행하고 있습니다.아웃솔이 넓고 단단하여 접지력이 좋고 미는 힘을 지면에 잘 전달하여 좋은 퍼포먼스를 낼수 있게 도와주는 제품입니다.웨이트 트레이닝을 좋아하시는 분은 재고 풀리면 마련해보시는 것 추천합니다.",1
1651,늦게 재입고 된걸 알아서 주문했는데 다행히도 아직 품절 전이라 바로 구매했습니다 역시 나이키 너무 편하구 좋습니다,1
1652,사랑합니다 나이키,1
1653,운동할때 신으면 수행능력이 업됩니다 ㅎㅎ,1
1654,중량충은 아니지만 접지력이 좋아 안정감 있어요,1
1655,작년에 재고없어서 리복으로 대체해서 신다가 이번에 재고들어온거 보고 바로 질렀습니다. 디자인부터가 마음에 드는데 리복꺼보다 가볍고 발이 편해서 장시간 운동시에도 발이 아프지가 않네요.,1
1656,보통 나이키 신을때는 270으로 신는데 풋살화나 역도화는 반업이 딱 좋습니다디자인은 그냥 끝,0
1657,역도화 중에서 유일하게 맘에 드는 제품이네요. 굿,1
1658,"반업해서 신었습니다. 아직 신고 스쿼트는 안해봤지만, 확실히 도움이 될것같아요.",1

1664,타 브랜드보다 가격대가 있어서 구매를 망설이다 결국 했는데 후회없습니다. 다음에도 역도화가 필요하다면 같은 모델이나 나이키 다른 모델로 구매하려합니다!,1
1665,디자인은 말할것도 없구요! 사이즈는 반업 해야한다는 후기가 많아서 정사이즈를 가야하나 반업을 해야하나 고민을 엄청나게 했는데 저는 발볼이 얇은편도 넓은편도 아니라 정사이즈로 갔는데 딱 맞고 좋습니다!,1

Within 6 weeks, the interior liner in the counter/heel cup had worn through. Very underwhelming durability for a “training” shoe. Especially when previous Metcon models were very well made.",1

1747,I purchased the metcon 9 over the 8 due to price and availability so we will see how these hold up. Originally bought two pair of the metcon 8's each lasting six months before a hole would form in the middle front and the material on the heel started to come off. Also the 8's had an issue of the sole separating from the shoe in the front so I wanted to give the 9's a chance to see if they hold up,0

As a size 14 with a bunion and very picky, these have met all my expectations and I will be buying a pair in white. Cheers y'all.",1

1762,"Still only a few weeks old and they're good for the gym floor, especially for things like back weight squats, deadlifts etc where I've taken my trainers off in the past for. Only slight niggle is the top of the shoe around the lower ankle is quite rigid but I'm guessing that will ease after some more use.",1

They are a little loud and clunky to run in but that’s not what they’re intended for so it’s not that big of a deal. Would have given it 5 stars but for $150 the quality control is lacking . I got the black and grey ones and there’s visible glue all over the shoe.",1

1773,"Honestly, thee best Metcon so far. Admittedly, I found these awful and plain looking initially. After finally purchasing, I was silenced when I realized the true quality of this shoe. Heavy lifts, circuits, and daily use; this model has covered it all. Smooth while walking and handling daily tasks, yet sturdy for crossfit, but grounded for compound movements. The amount of detail that has gone",0
1774,"Really wish they would go back to the Metcon 5 style.. every year these get bulkier, heavier and stiffer. These have wayyy to much padding around the shoe and it feels thick and heavy. Definitely can’t do any running in these. I’ve owned many pairs of the metcons and these are by far the worst.",0

1780,"Oof where to start. First they are not a good looking shoe (I was hoping the feel and functionality would help overlook this and just never looking down). Second, this thing feels like a boot. If you like Metcon 6s, Nano 2.0, or Nano 4.0 you're probably going to hate these shoes as I do. Third, the middle sole is carved out for the rope rubber and it makes them feel less stable for lifting because",0
1781,"I love these shoes! Perfect for every aspect of my gym workout! Plenty of support, and fit comfortably.",1
1782,So far my favorite Metcon.  Perfect in the gym and not as clunky as the previous model for short runs. They feel extremely light on your feet.,1
1783,"Great shoe, amazing for any lift or form of weightlifting",1
1784,"Excellent, they are super comfortable and do not bother you when lifting weights",1
1785,Love these shoes for deadlifts and squats. They fit great . Look great!,1
1786,"Comfortably , good material ten stars",1
1787,"I love it, everything was perfect on time",1
1788,This is my 4th version of Metcons and I can confidently say this is by far the best Metcon. The toe box is slightly wider than previous versions and the upper is much more flexible for more cardio workouts.,1
1789,"Good lifting shoes, but the Metcon’s get uglier every year, with worse integration of the rope guard. It’s now just a giant chunk of rubber glued on the side. The 4s were so much nicer looking. Just reissue those.",0
1790,Great for lifting and rope climbs. Not so great for running. My previous Metcon 5s were a little better all around CrossFit shoe. I will definitely wear different shoes for workouts with any amount of running.,1
1791,"First pair of workout sneakers, Major difference from non workout footwear. Increased balanced was the first significant noticeable change. Second was improved form.",0
1792,"I wanted to like this shoe. Toe box looked large and I have had success with the fit of previous versions of the Metcon.But this shoe is really heavy, inflexible, and fits like a boat.I can get the stiffness as the goal was for more stability, but the fit is sloppy. Loose on top and no way to really snug it down.It seems to be made for a really high volume foot.",1
1793,"I really liked these, until my first workout with kipping HSPU - the outsole completely ripped away from the shoe on the heels, massive build oversight. Never had this happen with the previous few metcons or Nanos. Disappointing.",0
1794,"The first workout shoe I feel comfortable in. Can't recommend enough, finally not tearing my heel open like that other brand.",1
1795,"Shoe is decent, a bit stiff and uncomfortable, almost like a weight-lifting shoe. The shoe has this big area to protect it from ripping when doing rope climbs, but my shoe actually ripped on the bottom of the shoe on the first rope climb workout I did (7 total rope climbs). The Nike return process isn't great - you send the shoes in at your cost, then you get a voucher for the retail of the shoes",0
1796,I bought this as my first gym shoe and it has not disappointed. I previously used normal trainers and could feel the difference. It gave me a good solid base for my deadlifts and squats. I wouldn’t recommend for long runs but it is good for running as a warm up on the treadmill before a work out,0
1797,Absolutely love these . I’ve had Metcons previously but these are a definite upgrade . They have the same sturdiness which is great for the gym but are much more comfortable than before meaning they are also great for cardio as well as weight training .,1
1798,My first dedicated workout shoe and it makes a ton of difference in my stability when I lift. my feet and body feel so stable and the shoe is super comfortable and stylish at the same time. they really put some features in this shoe to help in the gym I'm a fan now,1
1799,Great you give lots of stability while working out highly recommend them,1
1800,"The Nike Metcon 9 AMP boasts top-tier quality materials, ensuring both durability and optimal stability. Truly a game-changer for fitness enthusiasts!",1
1801,"Great shoes for CrossFit and gym training, stability is awesome and design is stunning. however, the sole is ripping off on the first wear on both the shoes at the same corner looks like a manufacturing defect.",1
1802,Owned a few Metcons in the past and the quality wasn’t there including what it was supposed to do - ie stability and comfort - the holy grail of getting both right. The 9 AMP changed all of that. It’s probably the best shoe I have ever used and meets all the criteria’s set out by NIKE. All I ask for NIKE is please produce more colours!,1
1803,"Feel great, better fit than previous model. However, they are too hot, they don’t breathe all that well.",1
1804,Huge improvement in comfort and stability with more room for the toes. I will be buying another pair.,1
1805,"I've got over 30 Metcons in my CF arsenal, starting since the 4s.  The Metcon 9 is by far the BEST trainer of all time.  Why?  Because it's wider overall base and forefoot creates more stability when preforming functional fitness movements, which gives the athlete confidence to push up the intensity during the WOD.  The cushioning feels softer than the 7 or 8s, which is a good thing, but it",1
1806,The improvement of the shoes are significant with stability and with a wider toebox to take a better grip with the toes for cleans and snatches. Running and cardio workouts are a  more comfortable.,1
1807,"I’ve owned previous generations of Metcons and these are the best ones yet. Even though they have a slightly higher profile, they feel incredibly stable and firm. These are as good as it gets for squatting and heavy lifting, without buying powerlifting shoes. Love the new flap for hiding the shoe laces and I would, overall, just highlight the high quality build of this shoe.",1
1808,"Right out of the gate I love the design of this shoe, really modern and sleek. They’re great for the gym. Super comfortable, breathable and offer great stability during workouts. But they’re also great for all day wear. Found myself wearing them while running errands and they felt really nice, cool and lightweight. All around these are awesome shoes that I’d recommend to anyone.",1
1809,Wider toe box is game changer 🔥 comfortable and you feel better the power of the foots,1
1810,The shoes are attractive. I received multiple unsolicited comments about how cool they looked. I have a wide foot and these shoes felt very accommodating. They are somewhat stiff with less padding than I would have preferred on the sides and bottom- could probably benefit from a gel insert.  The rubber on the sole of the shoe felt a little stiff and was a little noisier on hard surfaces than a,1
1811,"My husband wore these to the gym for his workout and he felt that while they were durable and high quality, the shoes felt heavy on his feet. They felt comfortable while he was walking around but they sounded loud and he didn't like running in them. He said there didn't seem to be much shock absorption.",0
1812,"When I first received them, I couldn't wait to try them on! I have been searching to find a good fit cross trainer for my weight training workouts, and these shoes are just right! They slide on very easily, and are very comfortable and fit true to size. I have used them several times and they are so comfy and provide amazing support during my personal training sessions and weight training workouts! I highly recommend these!",1
1813,"I am primarily a runner (3-5 runs/10 miles per week) who is looking to get in some additional at-home cardio and strength training, and needed a solid shoe to help get me through backyard and basement workouts (primarily HIIT). The Nike Metcon 9 fit the bill. I expect a lot out of my shoes, and sometimes struggle to find something that balances comfort with strength. After a few weeks wearing",1
1814,"I actually love these shoes for comfort and style. I am by no means a CrossFit person, but still really like wearing these for all day wear to make sure I'm comfortable and don't have to worry about my feet aching after doing a lot of walking. I'm a Midwest mom and even taking my kids to the county fairs my feet felt fine the whole time -- if you know, you know.",1
1815,These shoes are solid and have a sleek look. They are breathable and have a comfortable design. They are versatile and can be used for everyday wear as well as the gym. They don’t have as much arch support as other shoes I have worn but are still a great pair of shoes. The only thing I would recommend is not covering up the Nike logo as much.,1
1816,"My job requires me to be on my feet all day and run back and forth from one end of a building to the other. I usually peel off my shoes at the end of the day and rest my aching feet. These shoes are quite the game changer. I spent all day with them on, cycled home, and went for a run with little discomfort. They appear to be well made and durable, so we will have to see how long I take to run them",1
1817,"Imagine our delight when we opened the box and saw the ""cool as fudge"" Metcons staring back at us. The whole family gathered to ooh and ahh over the shoes. My husband wore them around the house, said they felt very comfortable and looked so stylish. According to my husband, they're flat enough to feel comfortable while lifting weights and have some support for jumps, etc. Keep coming up with interesting new shoes Nike!",0

1827,I ordered to the all black shoe to officiate HS and middle school basketball 🏀 Upon trying them on they felt like size 16 becuz I have the LeBron 21 and the sizes are similar. The season is coming up so it’s too late to send back and I don’t wana risk the 14 being tight. Yall definitely need to confirm shoe sizes wherever they are manufactured,0

1830,"I started working with weights so decided to try these for stability. Love them. They are good for that and also some of my cardio and strength training classes. I noticed a lot of work out video instructors wear these and now I know why!  I don't think they run wide, but there is a little extra room on the top of one part of my foot. So far it has not been a problem or felt loose. Super comfy to wear and love the bright blue. Good quality shoe.",1
1831,Perfect for my husband's feet. He loves them and wears them almost every day.,1
1832,Great shoe! But I noticed its a tad wider around my foot arc area than the previous generation Metcon 5 which I have 3 pair. I have a narrow foot so I have to wear 2 pair of socks when I use these.,1

1838,The Metcon series is a fantastic line of training and wearing kicks. I've had 2 pairs of 5 & now the 6 series comfortable with the perfect amount of support for Crossfit & light jogging I do inside. Highly recommend any of these training shoes in so many super colors to select from.,1
1839,"Nice looking show with great traction but the sock type fit is not my favorite. Also, it slightly wider than other trainers I’ve used, For my foot, which is not wide, it’s not a good combination.",1

1841,"Comfortable for working out, nice and stable base.",1
1842,"Not so sure! I have a few metcon 5 that I love for my workout but these fall short of function. They are wide , my feet are not as flat in these like I prefer. I would say these shoes are still in the testing stage. I ordered 2 pairs one will be returning, the other I will keep in rotation. I think they are good for walking so far.",1
1843,"This Metcon are way different from the 4 and 5, the bottom of the shoe feels cheap, is kinda like Nike was trying to make a workout/running shoes at the same time. The 4 and 5 are pretty good, but this one (6) you don’t get the stability or the support for workout, they feel like you are walking on sponges. This one is more like a running shoe than a workout one. Not the same as the ones before. I had to return them.",0
1844,"I am a Metcon Free fan through and through. I’ve had the last several models of the shoe and have never had any issues. I was excited to be gifted this shoe for my birthday. Unfortunately, the material on them was not the aesthetic (they appear like neoprene) I was looking for, but knowing the comfortability of previous models I was excited to get to work. Within only a few workouts, I noticed the",0

1846,"True to fit. Very comfortable. Quality is good, but they just look a bit cheap",1
1847,I am glad to see that this version has the loop in the back and on the tongue to help me get these sneakers on.  Love that (they were kept out in some of the previous versions).  But I do not agree with the decision on using those tiny string-like things to pull the laces through.  They will not stand the test of time like previous versions.  I expect they are trying to cut costs while not cutting,0
1848,Will make a repurchase once the current pair run out. The shoe has delivered well and is going to be the the bar against which I try on any other training/gym shoes.,1
1849,Nice and soft.Thank you nike👍,1
1850,Exceptionally comfortable and my husband loves it so much he is going to buy another pair.,1
1851,"I love the color and the style and they feel amazing. Honestly, I don’t have any dislikes as of right now with the shoe when I work out, they literally hug my feet perfectly.",1
1852,"They are great, but with a few kinks. I’ve always been a good 10.5 in Nike. I had to return the 10.5 of these because they were too big, both in length and width. Also, I’ve always liked that Nike has the right size laces. Well, these are too long. So, a bit disappointing in that sense, but they are indeed really good.  I had just bought the Free Metcon 5s and then realized the 6s were already",1

I don’t wear these throughout the day, 90% of the time they are worn only during workouts. The 6s are back to a wider toe box, more arch support while somehow feeling like a softer sole. They’re great for workouts, stable",1

1856,"When I first saw this model, I wasn’t sure about it. I bought it for the aesthetics and color Hoping they would fit similar to the 5’s. These feel much bigger and way wider. The little string that holds a shoelace almost feels like it’s gonna rip. We will see how long that will last. the 5’s feel way more durable and better on your feet. The material feels like it won’t last long. Almost looks",0
1857,"The first time I put them on I was unsure and felt a little too stiff for my liking, but once I started moving around my initial thoughts went out the window. From lifts, walks, and everything in between I felt comfortable and supported in these beauties! I was able to go from heavy squats to box jumps with no problem and was never uncomfortable during my sessions. These are now a must have for when I hit the gym.",1
1858,"I used these in the gym a few times now. My workouts mainly include weight training and plyometrics. The sole feels more flexible and the heel feels even more cushioned than a previous version I had. These updates were clutch for burpees and box jumps!

Wishing I stuck with my normal shoe size on this version, I went half a",1
1860,"These Metcons are very comfortable! Although as someone with wide feet, it takes some time to get used to. I think a half size up would’ve provided a better fit because of my wide feet.

Can't wait to wear them out to different workouts!",1
1861,"These are so light and amazing! They are much lighter and easier to wear than past models. They also have more of a flexible bottom which makes them feel very natural when training in them. I feel very sturdy and stable in them as well. The toe box is not too tight though I do wish there was a bit more stretch on the side of them, but hoping that will get better over time. Other than that I have",1

It was time for a new pair of shoes and so glad I gave the TR1 a shot.  Great spring/bounce around the balls of the feet.  Good toe support especially for the big toe.  And now my ankles/shins don’t hurt from,1

2053,"I've owned several of the previous generations of the Free Metcon, which I've always loved. I've always thought they were the perfect gym shoe. When I tried these on I literally said ""Wow"", they are SO comfortable. I've liked versions in the past but I love these! They have some stretch, but also feel snug and keep me stable. Wishing I stuck with my normal shoe size on this version, I went half a",1
2054,"These Metcons are very comfortable! Although as someone with wide feet, it takes some time to get used to. I think a half size up would’ve provided a better fit because of my wide feet. I wore them out to the gym, and I was impressed with the versatility between cardio and weights! While walking, I noticed the shoe has amazing flexibility in the front. Can't wait to wear them out to different workouts!",1
2055,"These are so light and amazing! They are much lighter and easier to wear than past models. They also have more of a flexible bottom which makes them feel very natural when training in them. I feel very sturdy and stable in them as well. The toe box is not too tight though I do wish there was a bit more stretch on the side of them, but hoping that will get better over time. Other than that I have",1
2056,"I tried this shoe out for different exercises and it always provides the right amount of cushioning and stability I need to get through my workouts. Some exercises I have done are some heavy lifts (between 145-275 lbs.) & HIIT cardio (burpees, box jumps, jumping jacks, mountain climbers, etc.) and they feel amazing!

2063,Order a full size bigger. Fit small and narrows at the toe. Other than that great shoe.,1
2064,"I was searching for a good workout shoe. Checked out no bull, hoka, on, and Nike. Decided to go with these. After watching some YouTube reviews, I decided to go with these. They are stylish yet pretty functional for my workout needs. I usually wear an 8.5 and that is what I ordered. After putting them on, they fit pretty snug, but not to the point making it uncomfortable. Much more snug than other",1
2065,"Very nice shoe from the color to the style. I received many compliments and when I wear them in the gym, folks know I mean business. However, they run small. Nike usually fits me true to size but this particular shoe fit to tight. I exchanged it for a 1/2 larger and they fit perfect. The comfort and the support during weightlifting is unmatched and therefore considering another color in shoe. Hands down one of the best weightlifting shoes I've owned.",1
2066,Extremely comfortable and stylish shoe. I'm a size 8 but the shoe is tight near the front. I would get a slight size bigger at 8.5. The shoe just looks so amazing and can go with almost anything. Definitely worth the money.,0
2067,"These are the NBA Jams of weightlifting. “Is it the shoes?!” Yes. Yes, it is. I swapped my Metcoms out for these and added 20lbs to my DL and squat the first time I threw them on. I was able to get lower in the squat and they are super stable. They remind of ski boots when I walk around. Not exactly that bad, but these shoes are used to glue your feet to the floor. I love them. I’m a 13 in other Nikes. Ordered a 14. Fit great.",1

2070,Ok leg day was amazing.. aching in different zones to normal even REDUCED my PB due to the correct positioning. Even sat on shoulder press i was able to engage more from a stable platform.. A must buy if you dont want to ruin your everyday nike airs ect by pushing your toes through the mesh,0

2075,Order a larger than normal size. Im a 13 and I ordered a 14 based off of other reviews. Sturdy and I feel like I have a stronger base. This shoe is definitely going to help my squat form and base. Super steady heel that will not rock side to side during leg workouts. Love this shoe.,1

2077,"I love it. Comfortable, light. and sturdy.",1
2078,"Shoes are super cute, definitely make sure to order a half-size up. However they had no shoe tree protectors inside and they creased almost instantly  so that kinda sucked considering how much they were.",1
2079,Love the stability given by these. Didn't anticipate the impact these had on my Olympic lifting. Go up half a size,1
2080,Nice trainers and beautiful on design,1
2081,Perfect shoe for the gym. Great stability and cushion. Only drawback is the toe-box whatever size you normally wear you should go up a 1/2 size for it to be truly comfortable fit (if only I knew). But the shoe definitely turn heads and is meant for true workout animals.,1
2082,"Do not listen to the previous reviews about sizing. Everybody saying to buy a size bigger. You will just end up with shoes that are too big, like me.",0
2083,These were great looking and looks durable but you definitely need to size up.. I read the comments and someone recommended to size 1/2 up. I did but it was still too small...so i would say go a 1 full size up!,0
2084,Great,1
2085,Quality seemed ok but they are waaaaayyyy to tight! Order half size up! Not sure if that would have helped with the wideness but my pinky toe was suffocating. Returning these for the Romaleos 4.,0

2090,"Nike has a special shoe here. I wonder why it took so long. Think of a Metcon with some cushion, not too much, just enough to make a mile run doable. They are true to your Metcon size. Extremely comfortable, wide toes box and they look super cool. I been looking for months for a comfortable shoe for functional fitness, this is the shoe. I been wearing Metcons since the original one but been wanting a more comfortable shoe. More colors ASAP please. Well done Nike!",1
2091,Love the look. Seems like they would be comfortable but very undersized. For reference I wear size 12 in Jordan 1’s and purchased 12.5 in these TR1’s but need to size up to a 13. Would recommend - but size up accordingly.,0
2092,"Not only do they look good, but as a person that works out 6-7days a week these felt amazing. Lite in weight, very supportive on the sides and top, cushioned. Top Tier Training Shoe. Can’t wait For More Colors.",1
2093,"The LeBron TR 1 strikes the ideal balance of looks and functionality in an every day trainer. I personally put the trainers through a 3 hour leg day on first wear and they were incredibly comfortable and performed very well on a multitude of lifts ranging from Olympic to isolation. I’ve been a fan of the Mat Fraser Metcon’s for generations now, however the new LeBron TR 1 will be replacing those as my favorite gym trainers. Cannot wait for more color-ways!",1
2094,I’m a true size 14 in everything Nike but suggest you go up a size than normal. These are general fitness type trainers. I have every metcon/ nano to compare these too. Because of the restriction of the shoe size I had to wear them without socks but the material made them feel actually better without them on. These are good north south trainers. I wouldn’t do any heavy easy west cutting in them.,0

2179,Very comfortable walking shoes I love the high arch that feels like having my custom made shoe inserts on. This shoe is made perfectly for my feet.,1
2180,Nice quality nice for every day use,1
2181,Very comfy walking shoes. I really like how they rock your foot forward. I did go up 1/2 a size from my usual size in these and got the size I purchase for metcons and air maxes.,1
2182,Really comfortable trainers and look good. A bit tighter across the toes than my Pegasus but not too tight.,1
2183,These walking shoes are so comfortable this picture does not do justice the ordering process was easy the delivery was really fast I walk for hour and my feet did not hurt at all I will be purchasing another pair,1
2184,A very comfortable shoe. Very impressed,1
2185,Very comfortable and suitable for a walk jog session.,1
2186,"I’m pregnant and needed some new walking shoes for my aching feet. Let me tell you, these do not disappoint! Very comfortable and bouncy. I have arched feet, so they give me good support.",1
2187,"I want to preface this by saying that I usually do not write reviews unless someone asks. I am writing this review because this is my all-time favorite shoe and I buy a lot of shoes. I own the Motiva and the Nike Invincible 3. I love them both. They feel similar, like walking on a cloud or a marshmallow. I use this shoe for walking mostly. I average 10,000 steps per day. I used them in Tokyo for 4",1
2188,This is a nice shoe for walking. Wish I had brought sooner. Great shoes for the price. Definitely buying another pair in a different color,1
2189,I love the shoes and would love to have them all black!,1
2190,"So comfy. Fit true to my Nike size 10 as ever. I have previously used running trainers for my walking (just pavements / paths to get my steps in!), but these are superior. The emphasis is the rocker and cushioned heel makes it like walking on cloud - and they don’t have the same support / restriction that running trainers do. So this makes them more comfortable and breathable. Not sure how they’d hold up off-road, as they are great looking too!",1
2191,Oh yes!!!!! Need it in all black instead of black and white please.,0
2192,"Why three stars this is a good shoe, but is nowhere as soft as the INVINCIBLE RUN 3 The INVINCIBLE RUN 3 I still the softer more cushioned shoe. The INVINCIBLE RUN 3 is more stable and they don’t have the rocker effect like Nike Motiva. Why am I posting this review as I called customer service there was a lot of debate. No one was able to answer this question so I thought I’d add this onto",0
2193,"I love these shoes so much!! I have been using them for walking on my peloton tread. First, a while back I had stopped wearing Nike on the tread because they hurt my knees so bad. I switched to another brand and it was like night and day. So when I bought these shoes I did it because I thought they were cute and figured I’d wear them in a fashionable way. When I first put them on I was shocked!!",1
2194,"I’m a lifelong Nike brand user. So happy they have finally given us a true “walking” shoe. I am a power walker and absolutely love these shoes. Very comfortable right out of the box. Color choices are also very pleasing. Nike nailed it with these shoes. Just fyi, I wear a 9 in street shoes but always wear a 10 in Nike.  Thank you! 😊",1
2195,"I purchased these ahead of a city trip which would involve a lot of walking. As a sufferer of plantar fasciitis I needed something that would cushion my heel and these worked a treat! They are lightweight and have a lovely thick sole that made it comfortable to walk on.Based on other reviews, I did buy 1 size bigger - I'd recommend this too!",1
2196,"Like walking on a cloud! Very comfortable, I love the color as well! Received a lot of compliments!",1
2197,I have many size 9 Nike shoes and being a lazy shoe lace tier I wiggle my foot into loosely tied shoes but with this pair is tied and untied every wearing so even though this is still quality Nike product it will be sparsely worn.The fitting is a little too tight compare with my previous shoes.If your a lazy wearer and product returner like me then I suggest order a 1/2 size larger than your usual size for a more satisfying and comfortable fitting.,0

2202,Nike Motiva is fabulous. Its comfy and stylish. Product was delivered earlier than expected. Very impressed,1

2204,"I found this shoe to be unlike any shoe I’ve ever worn. As a person with balance issues, the Motiva took some getting used to because of the “slight rocking motion” I felt when I first started wearing them. In time I became used to them not being very flat and found them to be extremely comfortable during my 13 hour work days as a daycare owner. Jumping, running and the occasional climbing kept my",1

2207,"Love these trainers, super comfy and stylish.",1
2208,It’s only been 1 week since I’ve had them but so far so good. I purchased these for work bc I’m actively on my feet but I rotate my shoes quite frequently…I read a lot of reviews about these before deciding to purchase but I can honestly say that many of the reviews were Spot on…..extremely comfortable and light in my opinion. Great walking shoes. I’m considering purchasing another pair. Hope this helps!,1

These sneakers are versatile for the entire package and I'm impressed. Good job Nike.",1

I tried The Metcon 5 and a couple others, but none were as good as these. These have actual cushioning and support, even some springy-support on the ball of your foot that makes plyo workouts a dream. It seems like I may never find another shoe as good as my superreps, but these are the next best thing I’ve found.",1

2233,"So the age old Metcon debate of the 5s vs the 9s finally has another contender. As a hooper I am use to a little spring in my step but as I am in the weight lift I do need to be standing flat. Enter this shoe with the perfect amount of cushion to allow you to do all activities whilst also keeping you stable and secure under the iron. 9/10, only feedback would be that the cushion around the ankle could be a little softer. Keep them coming and more colour ways please!",1
2234,Very comfortable shoe that makes HIIT workouts awesome. The toe area is not stiff for anything like Bulgarian Splits or Mountain Climbers but I don’t mind that. Sometimes in HIIT classes we are required to run and it’s not comfortable in the METCON’s. I use METCON for gym only lifting and these for HIIT. I have the bone colored pair and these and they get dirty fast doing HIIT but I have good shoe,1

2237,"Cushion is comfortable, but the toe box is kinda loose. Fabric on toe box doesn’t hug your foot like knit.",0
2238,Flat out the most comfortable shoes I have. Nike needs to take this shoe and change the upper to a slip on for house slippers.,1
2239,Finally!  The perfect Nike shoe for plyometric workouts.  I love Metcons for lifting and Pegasus for running/dailys.  Up until now I’ve had to wear other brands for group class workouts.  It was time for a new pair of shoes and so glad I gave the TR1 a shot.  Great spring/bounce around the balls of the feet.  Good toe support especially for the big toe.  And now my ankles/shins don’t hurt from,1
2240,The fit is solid and the sole is great.  The inside of the shoe tends the buckle and bend on the inside of the arch.  Probably due to the weakest part of the she potentially being where the ventilation holes are on the inside,1
2241,Very nice comfortable shoes.Great look and feel too.,1
2242,My 16 year old grandson chose these shoes--he really likes them and I liked the great price.  We chose them because he has entered an Iron Man training program at his school.,1

Good job Nike.I chose blk/white/anthracite size 10. May need the Volt also. Most likely will need to shelve a backup pair as these will get a lot of use.",1
2245,Comfortable but they run bigger. Not easy to put and take them off.  Wouldn’t recommend this for summer as the materials make your feet warm in the heat and with training. Overall these are ok.,0
2246,They ok but borrow at back of heel,0
2247,Love these firm at the back for lifting nice cushioning at forefoot for running . Toe box is quite low for better hold run true to size . No idea how I’ll keep them clean !!! If your a none rope climber CrossFit hiit or gym goer these are for you .,0

2268,"Within 1 month, the sole had worn through to the plastic “lift wedge” in the heel. Now when I walk/run there is an annoying “click/tap” sound from the plastic hitting the concrete or asphalt. Within 6 weeks, the interior liner in the counter/heel cup had worn through. Very underwhelming durability for a “training” shoe. Especially when previous Metcon models were very well made.",1

2273,I Usually get the metcons  for training because I CrossFit but the style has changed they are bulkier and heavier the look is wider as well so it makes the foot appear bigger. This was my 4th pair  and sadly I’ll be returning these. I need something lightweight that’s still good for lifting,1
2274,Extremely Uncomfortable had to return,0
2275,"These simply do not hold up. They are extremely comfortable, which is why I gave them a two instead of a one. The outer sole wears away on the heal very easily. Once that is gone it sounds like you’re wearing tap shoes every time you take a step. Nike needs to fix this design flaw in the next version.",1

2277,The shoe is extremely comfortable and arrived remarkably quickly.,1
2278,I sprained my ankle in previous Metcon's... So I bought these Metcon 9's specifically for the stability and I love them! I stress tested my ankle in them for months and I cannot see an easy to sprain my ankle again. The stability and stiffness of the materials does create more noise while walking but it's worth it.,1

2287,I purchased the metcon 9 over the 8 due to price and availability so we will see how these hold up. Originally bought two pair of the metcon 8's each lasting six months before a hole would form in the middle front and the material on the heel started to come off. Also the 8's had an issue of the sole separating from the shoe in the front so I wanted to give the 9's a chance to see if they hold up,0

2289,Good materials. Ran a little big,1
2290,Improved over my Metcon 7’s. Better for short runs. But toe box is much roomier-may want to order half size smaller. Shoes also feel a little hot during tough workouts.,1
2291,Bought twice and both have had the same issue with a part of the sole coming lose within 6-8 weeks. Nike will refund you but it’s not a straight forward process. Would not recommend if you do crossfit.,0

2299,"Overall look is pretty cool. Overall feel and quality is horrible. Sides are so stiff it's bruising the underside of my ankle bone. Within a month not even working out in them, the rubber is coming off in chunks just leaving plastic at the very back of heel. When I'm walking there's a plastic noise hitting the floor with every step which is super annoying. Overall I hate them and do not wear them anymore.",0
2300,"Physical Therapist here. Been wearing these for about 4 months now, for both lifting and work. I have to say they are one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn in a minute. As someone who talks/recommends shoes on the regular, this is the first shoe Nike that I will endorse. As a size 14 with a bunion and very picky, these have met all my expectations and I will be buying a pair in white. Cheers y'all.",1
2301,I am very pleased with the trainers. Look good and perform really well in training. Had to go down a half size for the fitting. Also bought the Air Alpha’s in the matching colours.,1
2302,"Still only a few weeks old and they're good for the gym floor, especially for things like back weight squats, deadlifts etc where I've taken my trainers off in the past for. Only slight niggle is the top of the shoe around the lower ankle is quite rigid but I'm guessing that will ease after some more use.",1

2309,"Overall a good shoe. They fit wider than most Nikes I’ve tried on in the past. My foot isn’t wide enough for a wide EE shoe, but most Nikes strangle my foot so these are a perfect fit for me. They are a little loud and clunky to run in but that’s not what they’re intended for so it’s not that big of a deal. Would have given it 5 stars but for $150 the quality control is lacking . I got the black and grey ones and there’s visible glue all over the shoe.",1

2312,Good shoes ....nice to wear...fit size color amazing...,1
2313,"Honestly, thee best Metcon so far. Admittedly, I found these awful and plain looking initially. After finally purchasing, I was silenced when I realized the true quality of this shoe. Heavy lifts, circuits, and daily use; this model has covered it all. Smooth while walking and handling daily tasks, yet sturdy for crossfit, but grounded for compound movements. The amount of detail that has gone",0
2314,"Really wish they would go back to the Metcon 5 style.. every year these get bulkier, heavier and stiffer. These have wayyy to much padding around the shoe and it feels thick and heavy. Definitely can’t do any running in these. I’ve owned many pairs of the metcons and these are by far the worst.",0
2315,Fits true to size and very comfortable. Love how stable they are when doing squats. Feels great to lift in.,1

2319,Great shoes.  Fit well.  Work well when doing my Hiit exercise.,1
2320,"Oof where to start. First they are not a good looking shoe (I was hoping the feel and functionality would help overlook this and just never looking down). Second, this thing feels like a boot. If you like Metcon 6s, Nano 2.0, or Nano 4.0 you're probably going to hate these shoes as I do. Third, the middle sole is carved out for the rope rubber and it makes them feel less stable for lifting because",0
2321,"I love these shoes! Perfect for every aspect of my gym workout! Plenty of support, and fit comfortably.",1

2326,"Comfortably , good material ten stars",1
2327,"I love it, everything was perfect on time",1
2328,This is my 4th version of Metcons and I can confidently say this is by far the best Metcon. The toe box is slightly wider than previous versions and the upper is much more flexible for more cardio workouts.,1
2329,"Good lifting shoes, but the Metcon’s get uglier every year, with worse integration of the rope guard. It’s now just a giant chunk of rubber glued on the side. The 4s were so much nicer looking. Just reissue those.",0
2330,Great for lifting and rope climbs. Not so great for running. My previous Metcon 5s were a little better all around CrossFit shoe. I will definitely wear different shoes for workouts with any amount of running.,1
2331,"First pair of workout sneakers, Major difference from non workout footwear. Increased balanced was the first significant noticeable change. Second was improved form.",0
2332,"I wanted to like this shoe. Toe box looked large and I have had success with the fit of previous versions of the Metcon.But this shoe is really heavy, inflexible, and fits like a boat.I can get the stiffness as the goal was for more stability, but the fit is sloppy. Loose on top and no way to really snug it down.It seems to be made for a really high volume foot.",1
2333,"I really liked these, until my first workout with kipping HSPU - the outsole completely ripped away from the shoe on the heels, massive build oversight. Never had this happen with the previous few metcons or Nanos. Disappointing.",0
2334,"The first workout shoe I feel comfortable in. Can't recommend enough, finally not tearing my heel open like that other brand.",1
2335,"Shoe is decent, a bit stiff and uncomfortable, almost like a weight-lifting shoe. The shoe has this big area to protect it from ripping when doing rope climbs, but my shoe actually ripped on the bottom of the shoe on the first rope climb workout I did (7 total rope climbs). The Nike return process isn't great - you send the shoes in at your cost, then you get a voucher for the retail of the shoes",0
2336,I bought this as my first gym shoe and it has not disappointed. I previously used normal trainers and could feel the difference. It gave me a good solid base for my deadlifts and squats. I wouldn’t recommend for long runs but it is good for running as a warm up on the treadmill before a work out,0
2337,Absolutely love these . I’ve had Metcons previously but these are a definite upgrade . They have the same sturdiness which is great for the gym but are much more comfortable than before meaning they are also great for cardio as well as weight training .,1
2338,My first dedicated workout shoe and it makes a ton of difference in my stability when I lift. my feet and body feel so stable and the shoe is super comfortable and stylish at the same time. they really put some features in this shoe to help in the gym I'm a fan now,1
2339,Great you give lots of stability while working out highly recommend them,1
2340,"The Nike Metcon 9 AMP boasts top-tier quality materials, ensuring both durability and optimal stability. Truly a game-changer for fitness enthusiasts!",1
2341,"Great shoes for CrossFit and gym training, stability is awesome and design is stunning. however, the sole is ripping off on the first wear on both the shoes at the same corner looks like a manufacturing defect.",1
2342,Owned a few Metcons in the past and the quality wasn’t there including what it was supposed to do - ie stability and comfort - the holy grail of getting both right. The 9 AMP changed all of that. It’s probably the best shoe I have ever used and meets all the criteria’s set out by NIKE. All I ask for NIKE is please produce more colours!,1
2343,"Feel great, better fit than previous model. However, they are too hot, they don’t breathe all that well.",1
2344,Huge improvement in comfort and stability with more room for the toes. I will be buying another pair.,1
2345,"I've got over 30 Metcons in my CF arsenal, starting since the 4s.  The Metcon 9 is by far the BEST trainer of all time.  Why?  Because it's wider overall base and forefoot creates more stability when preforming functional fitness movements, which gives the athlete confidence to push up the intensity during the WOD.  The cushioning feels softer than the 7 or 8s, which is a good thing, but it",1
2346,The improvement of the shoes are significant with stability and with a wider toebox to take a better grip with the toes for cleans and snatches. Running and cardio workouts are a  more comfortable.,1
2347,"I’ve owned previous generations of Metcons and these are the best ones yet. Even though they have a slightly higher profile, they feel incredibly stable and firm. These are as good as it gets for squatting and heavy lifting, without buying powerlifting shoes. Love the new flap for hiding the shoe laces and I would, overall, just highlight the high quality build of this shoe.",1
2348,"Right out of the gate I love the design of this shoe, really modern and sleek. They’re great for the gym. Super comfortable, breathable and offer great stability during workouts. But they’re also great for all day wear. Found myself wearing them while running errands and they felt really nice, cool and lightweight. All around these are awesome shoes that I’d recommend to anyone.",1
2349,Wider toe box is game changer 🔥 comfortable and you feel better the power of the foots,1
2350,The shoes are attractive. I received multiple unsolicited comments about how cool they looked. I have a wide foot and these shoes felt very accommodating. They are somewhat stiff with less padding than I would have preferred on the sides and bottom- could probably benefit from a gel insert.  The rubber on the sole of the shoe felt a little stiff and was a little noisier on hard surfaces than a,1
2351,"My husband wore these to the gym for his workout and he felt that while they were durable and high quality, the shoes felt heavy on his feet. They felt comfortable while he was walking around but they sounded loud and he didn't like running in them. He said there didn't seem to be much shock absorption.",0
2352,"When I first received them, I couldn't wait to try them on! I have been searching to find a good fit cross trainer for my weight training workouts, and these shoes are just right! They slide on very easily, and are very comfortable and fit true to size. I have used them several times and they are so comfy and provide amazing support during my personal training sessions and weight training workouts! I highly recommend these!",1
2353,"I am primarily a runner (3-5 runs/10 miles per week) who is looking to get in some additional at-home cardio and strength training, and needed a solid shoe to help get me through backyard and basement workouts (primarily HIIT). The Nike Metcon 9 fit the bill. I expect a lot out of my shoes, and sometimes struggle to find something that balances comfort with strength. After a few weeks wearing",1
2354,"I actually love these shoes for comfort and style. I am by no means a CrossFit person, but still really like wearing these for all day wear to make sure I'm comfortable and don't have to worry about my feet aching after doing a lot of walking. I'm a Midwest mom and even taking my kids to the county fairs my feet felt fine the whole time -- if you know, you know.",1
2355,These shoes are solid and have a sleek look. They are breathable and have a comfortable design. They are versatile and can be used for everyday wear as well as the gym. They don’t have as much arch support as other shoes I have worn but are still a great pair of shoes. The only thing I would recommend is not covering up the Nike logo as much.,1
2356,"My job requires me to be on my feet all day and run back and forth from one end of a building to the other. I usually peel off my shoes at the end of the day and rest my aching feet. These shoes are quite the game changer. I spent all day with them on, cycled home, and went for a run with little discomfort. They appear to be well made and durable, so we will have to see how long I take to run them",1
2357,"Imagine our delight when we opened the box and saw the ""cool as fudge"" Metcons staring back at us. The whole family gathered to ooh and ahh over the shoes. My husband wore them around the house, said they felt very comfortable and looked so stylish. According to my husband, they're flat enough to feel comfortable while lifting weights and have some support for jumps, etc. Keep coming up with interesting new shoes Nike!",0
2358,Great shoes. Im a size 13 and bought a sz 14 beauty i heard they run big. They do run big just wish they had sz 13.5 so i can have more of a snug fit for training. More comfortable than free metcon,1
2359,"Nike has a special shoe here. I wonder why it took so long. Think of a Metcon with some cushion, not too much, just enough to make a mile run doable. They are true to your Metcon size. Extremely comfortable, wide toes box and they look super cool. I been looking for months for a comfortable shoe for functional fitness, this is the shoe. I been wearing Metcons since the original one but been wanting a more comfortable shoe. More colors ASAP please. Well done Nike!",1
2360,Love the look. Seems like they would be comfortable but very undersized. For reference I wear size 12 in Jordan 1’s and purchased 12.5 in these TR1’s but need to size up to a 13. Would recommend - but size up accordingly.,0
2361,"Not only do they look good, but as a person that works out 6-7days a week these felt amazing. Lite in weight, very supportive on the sides and top, cushioned. Top Tier Training Shoe. Can’t wait For More Colors.",1
2362,"The LeBron TR 1 strikes the ideal balance of looks and functionality in an every day trainer. I personally put the trainers through a 3 hour leg day on first wear and they were incredibly comfortable and performed very well on a multitude of lifts ranging from Olympic to isolation. I’ve been a fan of the Mat Fraser Metcon’s for generations now, however the new LeBron TR 1 will be replacing those as my favorite gym trainers. Cannot wait for more color-ways!",1
2363,I’m a true size 14 in everything Nike but suggest you go up a size than normal. These are general fitness type trainers. I have every metcon/ nano to compare these too. Because of the restriction of the shoe size I had to wear them without socks but the material made them feel actually better without them on. These are good north south trainers. I wouldn’t do any heavy easy west cutting in them.,0
2364,"Stable heel and high, firm arch support.  The outside rubber extends beyond my small toes and restricts movement.  Feels narrow.",1
2365,"Love the cable wire laces, cross trainers are great shoes and the fact Our Gloriouos King Lebron James can step into the realm of other shoe styles besides just basketball shoes shows how great my king really is.",1
2366,They look really good and comfortable,1
2367,Cross trainers are where I find my gem shoes. Glad Lebron has a signature workout shoe. Looks good in this OG color way.,1

2370,I ordered to the all black shoe to officiate HS and middle school basketball 🏀 Upon trying them on they felt like size 16 becuz I have the LeBron 21 and the sizes are similar. The season is coming up so it’s too late to send back and I don’t wana risk the 14 being tight. Yall definitely need to confirm shoe sizes wherever they are manufactured,0

The Elevation of the heels is great for",1
2373,"I started working with weights so decided to try these for stability. Love them. They are good for that and also some of my cardio and strength training classes. I noticed a lot of work out video instructors wear these and now I know why!  I don't think they run wide, but there is a little extra room on the top of one part of my foot. So far it has not been a problem or felt loose. Super comfy to wear and love the bright blue. Good quality shoe.",1
2374,Perfect for my husband's feet. He loves them and wears them almost every day.,1

2381,The Metcon series is a fantastic line of training and wearing kicks. I've had 2 pairs of 5 & now the 6 series comfortable with the perfect amount of support for Crossfit & light jogging I do inside. Highly recommend any of these training shoes in so many super colors to select from.,1

But I do not agree with the decision on using those tiny string-like things to pull the laces through.  They will not stand the test of time like previous versions.  I expect they are trying to cut costs while not cutting,0
