9,The shoes were very comfortable and didn’t stick to the grass in the soccer field. I loved the color and it’s trendy appearance.,1
10,"I can start by saying that after juggling for the first time Nike has added a new grit to the surface of the shoe and it is very grippy and sticky almost the feel to it to the touch even when I was picking the ball for the first time you can feel it. Nike has added the feature to the texture so you can have a better stick to the ball like if the ball is supposed to stay close to your foot, this is",1
11,"Although these shoes run a little big, the fit is great! I am normally a size 11 but need a size 10.5 for this shoe.The heel cushion and ankle sleeve make these super snug and the touch with these boots are fantastic and I was able to put a lot of action on my shots! I'm a big fan of the black and dark green on my pair and it only took me playing twice with them to really break them in. Definitely recommend these if you are a fan of turf shoes!",1
12,"I was looking for a a comfortable yet versatile indoor soccer cleat and these Zoom Vapor 16s is exactly what I have been looking for. Some other indoor soccer cleats I have found to be a bit tight and uncomfortable while playing in them. However, these Zoom Vapor 16s gave me enough comfort and traction. Surprisingly, these cleats also worked on turf quit well and did not experience a lot of slippage compared to other indoor cleats I have tried in the past. Two thumbs up!!",1
13,The design of the Zoom Vapor 16 Pro Soccer Cleats is a very nice soccer cleat. The all black cleats with a hint of blue makes the shoe look elegant. The leather on the cleat feels comfortable and the mesh on the top is stretchy so I can stretch it as I put them on. I do wish the laces were a tad bit longer so they way they will stay tied. Also I’m a size 9.5 and they felt a little snug so I would,1
14,The zoom vapor 16 pro is very sleek and just slides onto the feet. Wearing the shoe feels like there is very minimal material between my feet and the ground. This shoe sticks to your skin so I recommend going one size over your normal shoe size. Playing in this shoe gives good grip which helped me running on the grass. The design looks very minimal and will not gather attention.,1
15,"Fit and feel: I typically wear a size 10 when it comes to Nike, whether they are dunks, air maxes, Jordan’s or basketball shoes. The vapor pro 16s run a bit tight; if you like a tight fit, true to size will go well for you. But for myself, I think a half size up would give a little bit more comfort. I typically play in a striker role when playing. Quick stopping and cutting became a little bit",0
16,My husband is an indoor youth soccer coach. These cleats have outperformed themselves on all levels. They are great for an indoor turf. They are comfortable and have great arch and ankle support. The sleek look is stylish and versatile. They are also true to size. 10/10 highly recommended these cleats any day!,1
17,"These shoes are super comfortable right out of the box. They definitely fit true to size and had no break-in period. These shoes provide the perfect amount of comfort, ball control, and grip; all while being lightweight.",1
18,"The Nike Zoom Vapor 16 Pro is a great pick to wear when playing soccer on artificial grass/turf. Though they are made of leather and open up after some use, they do run slightly small. Additionally, due to their narrow design, they may not be comfortable for individuals with wide feet.I found the Nike Zoom Vapor 16 Pros to be average in terms of comfortability  on the field. They are",1
19,"The Zoom Vapor 16 Pro Soccer Cleats are both sleek and stylish but also light and comfortable! I used these cleats for men’s softball and was please to find that they gave good traction on both the dirt and grass. I never felt like I was slipping even with the intended use being for turf. Compared to my last set of cleats which were also soccer cleats, these performed much better in terms of grip",1
20,"I wore these shoes for 4 games and they performed well on indoor carpet. I found them to have less grip on turf. The uppers are a little bit hard so you need to break them in, but are comfortable afterwards. The fit is snug enough without being too tight. The quality is good for recreational soccer but if you’re competing at a higher level you may need the elite version.",1
21,"The Nike Zoom Vapor 16 Pro are a great innovation in soccer cleats.  The fit of the shoe makes them a perfect cleat to play at a high level.  Nike created a light weight, well balance, and comfortable shoe that will make playing fun and exciting.I loved the heel padding that gave support to my Achilles and helped with heel locking.  The shoe has amazing traction to help with lateral",1
22,"I'll be honest when I first opened the box, I felt a little disappointed. I thought the soccer shoes looked a little stale and boring. It's been awhile since I've boughten soccer shoes. I'm used to soccer shoes with a thicker material then these Nike zoom vapor 16 pro soccer cleats. I do like that they are made from 20% recycled material. I was surprised after I tried on the shoes, how well",0
23,"Nike's newest iteration of the Vapor misses the mark in the turf edition. Everything new and innovative we are supposed to get in the 16 is not present in the turfs. Granted Nike only offers turfs in their Pro and Academy models, these Pro models felt like what you'd find in the Academy model. None of the Elite features are present. I was excited to try these but after several games I was just",0
24,"These cleats run true to size and are very comfortable. The black on black design is sharp looking. The shiny pieces with the matte look go well together! These will definitely work better on turf, but my son found they worked well in short grass as well. They broke in easily and he loved the elastic area around the ankle.",1
25,"Nike really stepped up their game with these Zoom Vapor 16 soccer cleats. This specific model is perfect for playing on turf fields and the grip pattern on the sole ensures that you have the proper traction and stability when playing or practicing. It is important to consider these factors, as often times poor traction footwear on turf fields leads to injury. The Zoom Vapor 16s are incredibly",1
26,"The design of zoom vapor pro soccer cleats secures the foot for total lockdown while changing directions quickly without sliding. I love the traction that provides stability even when the grass/ field is wet. The upper material which has a tactile feel to it. That It gives you a more natural on-ball feel when you dribble, pass, or score because it is stable but soft and tightly wraps around your",1
27,"Great turf shoe.  Grippy, feel like I can cut solidly on these and not lose my footing.  I like the sock liner how they changed it to more of a low vs the previous versions that would cover my ankle.  The Achilles pad is a nice touch for increased comfort and snugness.  My foot doesn’t slip at all in these shoes.  I use to get some Achilles blisters with the older versions so the new pad at the heel I feel helps a lot.  I’m between a 9-9.5 and went with the 9.5 and it feels perfect.",1

31,I wanted to get black shoes it's great color,1
32,"Shoes are amazing, fly knit makes it super comfortable for all feet shapes and sizes. Made from material that allows you to really feel the ball...I have tried many boots over the years, simply by far the best",1
33,"I just tried two sizes 9.5 was way too tight, and 10, though fitting better, was too long. The quality feels cheap compared to other pro-TFs I've had in the past. I miss the leather tiempos.",0
34,"착화감, 터치감 다 좋고 아직 몇번밖에 안 신긴했지만 내구성도 좋은 것 같습니다. 원래 처음 신는 신발은 길들여야(?) 발에 맞는데 이것은 처음부터 발에 맞아서 편안합니다. 한가지 단점은 흰 양말을 신은 채로 경기를 하면 신발 입구 쪽에서 검은색 물질이 묻어서 양말이 더러워진다는 것입니다.",1

38,일단 들어가는 입구도 쉬워지고 착 감기는게 좋은느낌입니다,1
39,"I gotta say, the Nike Design team nailed it with these… I play alot on artifical grass and turf, and I’ve been wearing my Premiere 3’s for about a year now….and while those have been good, these tiempo 10 pro TF’s are the holy grail. The market kinda has limited options for turf (TF) cleats, but I think Nike can expand on this formula for a while now. They should do 100 different colorways.",1
40,I play a lot of grass volleyball and have wide flat feet so this shoe is a tad bit too narrow/small; if you wear thin socks then you’ll be fine. Other than that; this shoe is the best shoe I’ve worn for grass volleyball; the traction is great and I feel like I have nothing on it’s so light. 100% would recommend but maybe get half a size up.,1
41,They are to narrow compared to other years. I bought the same size as last time and the dont fit as they used to.,1
42,"They’re comfortable but way to true to size , im a 9 and they’re tight since they get narrower to the toes.",1
43,"Honestly these are great ! They feel amazing , I have 9s in FG and decided to pick these up for Turf. For me they fit just like 9s , I’m true to size 10.5 and I have wide feet ! These are very low profile , and this is why I picked these over other models !",1
44,"Best astro turf boots for me. I’ve bought the best every brand has to offer. These have the best fit for me. I have wide fit but these have taken shape and held it firmness, not feeling sloppy on my feet. Touch, passing and shooting feels great.",1

51,Fantastic boots for my son who has wide feet. He is so pleased with them. Definitely recommend to go up half a size.,1
52,Great cleats and very stylish. My 12yo loves them.,1
53,Better quality than the mercurial vapor 15. Still needed to go 1 size up. The pink isn't as pink in the picture.,0
54,"Very tight fitting and that was even going with a size up for our daughter, Had to go with a different style with a sock that was same size but a lot more comfortable",1
55,Great boots. Definitely small made though. I am normally a 4 and needed 5s. Great quality and the stud lay out has definitely boosted the confidence I have after returning from knee injuries,1

58,Very nice shoes like it a lot super happy buy again in the future,1
59,"Nike please work on the size QC, I noticed Nike soccer shoes now run at least half size smaller than its original size.  The phone here is comparing a size 8 running shoe I bought couple years ago to the recent purchased 8.5 phantom…. The 8.5 size phantom turf shoes fit me well but I’m a bit disappointed that  Nike QC team isn’t doing a good job.",0

65,"Very Comfortable and raps around foot nicely.It is true to size, these cleats are known for narrow feet. If you prefer looser fit size up by half.",1
66,The quality of the boot is quite poor with significant amounts of damage after one wear for not even that long. the boot is very soft and doesn't give an support to the ankle or foot and the insole of the boot is very thin.,0
67,My 14yo daughter loves these. Felt great out of the box for a week of summer camp with 3 evening practices too! Fit was accurate. She loves the light blue color.,1
68,"The fit and the feel was very soft and comfortable. My feet usually hurt after playing but the padding on the inside of the shoe made the boots comfortable. The fit is a bit snug, if your feet is on the wider side I would consider going a half size up but I still liked the fit. The material and design of the shoe feels amazing. The leather and the sock seem and feel very durable. The design is",1
69,"Perfect color and style makes it look spectacular, very light to play and very comfortable to play on the grass.",1
70,These cleats are good but need some time to be broken as they were very narrow. They became more comfortable with some wear but still felt narrow compared to other pairs of cleats.,1
71,"Overall, the cleats are well-made and seem to be able to stand up to hard training and game use. The design is sleek and streamlined and definitely look great on the pitch. Sizing-wise, I’d recommend going up .5 or 1 full size as, I tried my normal size and they were pretty tight. Overall, as long as you try them on before purchasing to get the correct size, they’ll serve you well on the field.",0
72,"Perfect fit, usually buy a size bigger than my normal shoe size but these fit just right. I’ve worn similar models with the ankle fabric and it’s hard to put on but these have what I think is a new design where the seam is reinforced and slightly to the side where you can grab it with more confidence. It  feels natural to grab it from there instead of the center making it easier to grab it while",1
73,"The Nike Zm Superfly fit perfectly. They go on easily and they’re probably the most comfortable pair of cleats I've ever worn honestly. Usually, I cant get out my cleats fast enough. These, I almost forget that I even have cleats until my feet start making that cleats on concrete sound we all know and love. They're stylish as well. Innovative.",1
74,"The ZM Superfly 10 soccer cleats have truly impressed me with their performance. The design is sleek, and the materials used are top-notch, providing excellent support and comfort on the field. The grip and traction are exceptional, allowing for quick and precise movements.However, I did find that they run a bit small. I recommend going up half a size to ensure a perfect fit. Once you have",1
75,"The soccer boots are sublime. I love the feel of the sock-like upper for soccer, as it truly gives you best  feel of the ball. This style can sometimes sacrifice stability where the upper connects to the sole - that is not the case here. I have found the zm superfly to be stable in and out of cuts while remaining light and agile. Aesthetically, I think the boots are perfect. The black/black",1
76,"The balance between the ankle support but also the lightweight feel is top tier. After having ankle surgeries in the past, some cleats make me feel like I’m not fully supported, but this model still makes me feel comfortably supported but also allowing for agility and comfort.Style and colorway allows for kit versatility, but also very looks clean and professional.This cleat made",1

The sleek look make these cleats really stand out. They look awesome and make me feel like a pro.The fabric is solid and breathable, keeping my feet cool and dry during games. Plus, it gives a good grip and control, helping",1
78,"To start I want to provide a little bit about myself to express why I was concerned when I got the ZM Superfly 10 acad fg/mg. I am a big guy at 6’2 300 pounds, but I like to stay active and play sports such as football, basketball, and soccer. I was worried how these would handle my large frame, but shortly after putting these into action those concerns were alleviated. When unboxing the ZM",0
79,"It felt a little tight around the toe area, I would definitely recommend going a half size up if you plan on wearing thick socks. Although you should be fine staying true to size with a pair of lightweight socks. Other than that I absolutely love these cleats, I love how they look, super lightweight, easy to move around, easy to walk around in, and they feel durable. I know for a fact they will last me for a few years, I wish these came out sooner",1
80,Extremely lightweight Very comfortable Great practice shoe Good traction for stopping quick Loose ankle support but good pivot movement,1
81,Great soccer shoe overall. Like the snug fit it has and the extra cushion it provides on the heel makes it break in easier. The design of the outsole provides excellent traction on firm ground grass for quick movements and changes of pace. Overall feels like a soccer shoe thats designed make the players comfortable. Only downside it does run small. Would recommend ordering 1/2 to a 1 full size up depending on the fit you like,1
82,"Nike Superfly Cleats ReviewFit:For actual gameplay, I recommend going half a size up as they tend to be snug.

84,"Poor Boot from a company that clearly doesnt care for it's customers, it's not a quick boot as described and the quality is shocking",0
85,"To start with, this is the third pair of Zoom Vapors I’ve had. I’ve been in love with the shoe since it first launched, as its flexibility (mobility) and look are unrivaled. This latest version is a great new take on a classic design. The material feels incredibly light (better contact on the ball), yet durable—all while being made with at least 20% recycled materials.",1
86,"Overall, this pair of soccer cleats provides a positive experience for the sport. Putting them on was not the worst, although opening up the tongue one more eyelet would make it feel more comfortable to slip on. The shoe feels great on the foot as it provides a snug, comfortable fit that molds perfectly to the shape of my foot, ensuring maximum comfort and control on the field. There is less",1
87,"The cleats fit true to size. They are flexible enough to keep you stabilized during motion and planted in the field. As long as you lace them tight, you should not have any issues long term.  I could run in them just as fast as any shoe. The matte black material is pretty breathable with a subtle shine. I like wearing black shorts and black socks with these. The material surprisingly did",1
88,"Design: Right out of the box I thought the design was great. I am not a flashy person so the mostly black and subtle blue design was awesome. I think this colorway will relate with many soccer/fútbol enthusiasts.Fit/Feel: I did (2) 30-45 min workouts in these cleats; Running, Cutting, Cone drills, Sprinting, Passing, Shooting, Plyometrics to name a few. The fit wrapped around my feet like",1
89,"The Zoom Vapor 16 Academy is next the staple soccer cleat, but slow down and get the right fit.The Vapor 16 Academy is a great cleat, but make sure you size up half a size. I got them size 11. I would size up a bit because the toe box is snug.  Also, when using the shoes make sure to use soccer  socks. Once I used regular soccer socks instead of cushioned socks there shoe fit was better.",0
90,"This cleat has its highs and lows. At the end of the day, I can equate any issues to sizing, preference, and season. These cleats fit large–I should have ordered a half size (maybe whole size) smaller. If I had sized these better, these are easily one of the most comfortable boots I have owned. Otherwise, these feel great on the pitch. The studs are versatile and work great on our summer game",1
91,"Was able to put these to use in natural grass and synthetic grass, and I can say they performed in both! It took a while to break in but after a while they felt a lot better. The only other thing I would note would be the sizing, I’m a true size 8 but these felt a bit snug. Definitely go up half a size or a full size.",1
92,"The Zoom Vapor 16 Academy cleats feel like top of the line comfort boots with every step. The zoom air technology incorporated into the boots is noticeable by providing comfort and functionality. With every step and push off, I felt the boot propel and jolt me forward. The grip from the stud pattern also felt very sturdy on multiple playing surfaces. My initial 10+ hours in the boots on firm",1
93,They look nice would like just a tad more on the design other than that great shoe lightweight fits great easy on and off for a soccer shoes,1
94,The look of the cleat is nice and it has a cool design. My biggest is is it's a very narrow fit.,1
95,"The cleats feature a sleek and now, popular design, with the big 'AIR' letters in the heel which are aesthetically pleasing. The streamlined shape and lightweight materials is something that Nike has accustomed us to with the Zoom Vapor lineup, it aids in speed and agility, making them an easy choice for players looking to improve their game. The updated soleplate design provides more",0

97,Straight out of the box this felt like a high end elite model (comparing to Vapor 15 Elite that I own) a very tasteful color way. The complete black out makes it even more premium. The fit is true to size of my soccer cleats I use. I am a little more wide on my foot size and this fit perfectly. For the Vapor 15 Elite it took one session to break in but this was perfect from the box. The only,1
98,"The Nike Zoom Mercurial Vapor 16 soccer cleats are great for their performance, comfort, and innovative design. I loved the all black color way, which went with everything and was easy to clean.

104,cleats are very light and comfortable highly recommend them to anyone,1
105,"They look very nice but I'd like to ask if Nike could please make boots for big footed people, Maybe up to size 14.5 even.",0
106,"After 35+ years, Nike changed Tiempo to a 'sustainable' fabric rather than natural leather. Perfect for super narrow feet as opposed to the ONLY cleat option for wider feet. I'm all for sustainability yet they are incredibly snug and most likely will not stretch with the 'patented technology'. Back to the forever hunt to find a realistic toe box for an ATHLETIC BOOT. Continuously baffled at",1

108,This is the 3rd pair my sons had.  I was surprised that this time they’re made with 20% recyclable material which has changed to texture from the boot from a soft leather to a more plastic feel.My son still likes them and says they’re just a comfortable.,1

111,Not even close to the comfort level of previous models. Wat too stiff even when broken in.,0
112,Boots feel great. True to size!,0
113,"It really is a shame the direction they've taken with the Nike Tiempo Legend. I bought these to try on and see if they truly felt ""softer than natural leather"" as they were constantly claiming through social media, and I regret to share that I found them nowhere near softer than natural leather. In fact, the upper is just thinner and flimsy. Another disappointing aspect of these was the fit and",0
114,I personally like these cleats. They are no where near the legend 9 but still great considering they are not made out of leather. I would recommend sizing up if you have a wider foot like me.,1
115,Great cleat!!! Very similar to the Nike CTR cleat. Since it is not leather order a size up. I wear a 9 but I should have ordered a 9.5. Super comfortable!,1

Before i had the academy’s but i decided to see if it was worth paying extra, and it definitely is.The feel in passes and shots is much better and i feel more explosive, and while running i feel faster. great clear and i will continue to purchase superflys in the future",1
122,"These cleats/boots felt really good at kick while I was testing them out when I put them on it nice and comfortable I even felt like Ronaldo lol, but I recommend these cleats go try them yourself 😁",1
123,Ordered 1/2 size larger for a perfect fit. The additional support in the heal makes a for more comfort. The material seems to enable my daughter to more spin to bend the ball.,0
124,"I just got these and have worn them a couple of times. The first thing you see is the box and it is very pleasant looking, same thing with the bag it comes with. The cleats are very snug and the sock makes you feelVery secure. There is no slipping in them and they are great. The only thing about them is with the new material, they are very hard to clean.",1
125,These run small.  Definitely size up! They are lightweight and comfortable otherwise. They are grippy  and durable. The heel cup was comfortably snug.  All in all a good cleat.,1

They look amazing and my adult",1

However, they are pretty narrow so when initially putting them on they may feel tight but will break in the more you wear them.  If you have wider feet or like a loose fit I would probably recommend sizing up.  I got these in Black/Black Deep",1
132,The ZM Superfly 10 elite soccer cleats are a very beautiful design compared to previous versions of the model. One of the best features of the cleats would be the comfort and the soft feeling of the material that it’s made of. I wouldn’t change much about the product because it’s already perfect it has a cool look and it’s comfortable the two things that a soccer player looks for in a soccer cleat like this one.,1
133,I was looking for the right soccer cleats but wanted something that was very light weight and sleek and had been searching everywhere…until I ran into the Superfly 10s. When I say it feels like I’m running on clouds that’s an understatement. They are very comfortable and almost feel like all you have on are socks! One think I might say is to size up if you have a thicker foot for that comfort and great fit.,1

Having a wider foot and not many cleats fitting, these",1
140,Wow never thought cleats would fit so good. I always had fear because i have wide feet but these fit perfect. The material is so light made me feel way faster and less tired through the game. Amazing color making an all black shoe so interesting. Only downside was putting it on. Because of my wide feet and shin the high model makes it tough to put on but once on it literally fits like a glove. Getting a low version is a must.,1
141,Used the cleats first time for practice and they felt really comfortable the inside was soft and did not have me any blisters. Second time I used the cleats for a game and the shoe fits perfectly with no slipping of the foot. The material feels thick and not thin. One thing I would change about this cleats is the heal it felt a bit tight on my feet. I love the color.,1
142,The Cleats are AMAZING! These cleats felt great and performed so well on the soccer field that I now wear them on the football field too. I’m a kicker too and having both light and comfortable cleats is super important!

Not everyone will experience the same but for me, true to size worked. These boots are lightweight and comfortable. Need to ensure you loosen",1

222,"I really liked how the shoe fit me; for soccer I like when cleats fit me a little tighter than usual shoes so it was perfect for me. The cleat felt really lightweight and when I was playing soccer it felt like I had no cleats on at all. The one downside was that it was a bit hard to put on because I have a wide foot. Overall, the fit and feel of the cleats were better than other cleats that I have",1
223,"These are the lightest cleats I’ve ever worn. They’re too narrow for my wide feet though. The materials are stiff at first, but after a couple of wearing the material will heat up and conform to your foot. I like the pattern of the spikes near the toe and ball of your foot. It is in a circular pattern which makes spinning around effortlessly easy. The only thing I wished they improved on is the",1

I'm definitely happy with them!",1

Some other indoor soccer cleats I have found to be a bit tight and uncomfortable while playing in them. However, these Zoom Vapor 16s gave me enough comfort and traction. Surprisingly, these cleats also worked on turf quit well and did not experience a lot of slippage compared to other indoor cleats I have tried in the past. Two thumbs up!!",1
245,The design of the Zoom Vapor 16 Pro Soccer Cleats is a very nice soccer cleat. The all black cleats with a hint of blue makes the shoe look elegant. The leather on the cleat feels comfortable and the mesh on the top is stretchy so I can stretch it as I put them on. I do wish the laces were a tad bit longer so they way they will stay tied.

314,This is the 3rd pair my sons had.  I was surprised that this time they’re made with 20% recyclable material which has changed to texture from the boot from a soft leather to a more plastic feel.My son still likes them and says they’re just a comfortable.,1

319,"It really is a shame the direction they've taken with the Nike Tiempo Legend. I bought these to try on and see if they truly felt ""softer than natural leather"" as they were constantly claiming through social media, and I regret to share that I found them nowhere near softer than natural leather. In fact, the upper is just thinner and flimsy. Another disappointing aspect of these was the fit and",0
320,I personally like these cleats. They are no where near the legend 9 but still great considering they are not made out of leather. I would recommend sizing up if you have a wider foot like me.,1
321,Great cleat!!! Very similar to the Nike CTR cleat. Since it is not leather order a size up. I wear a 9 but I should have ordered a 9.5. Super comfortable!,1

The shoes are very light and comfortable overall. It's very fun to run in them and the shooting performance is great. Since the first use I already noticed how good they are for controlling the ball and dribbling. Materials are high quality, even if the leather is synthetic. Kudos to Nike for paying attention to details on this model.",1

333,"I havent played with them yet. But just walking aroud with them on feels just perfect. They are incredibly light. I have wide feet and usually soccer shoes feel very tight around the sides of my feet, but not these. They wrap around my foot perfectly allowing me to feel the ball perfectly. The quality of of the leather, the details and the finishings all over the shoe. I´m happy to say these are the best soccer shoes I´ve ever owned and I´ve been playing since I was 5.",1

All managed to be fixed…and I’m so glad that I managed it. No break in time required, these boots are hands down the best control I’ve ever felt with a boot. The grip knit is a game changer for dribbling, crossing and shooting. Massively upped my game. If you’re looking for that next level in your game these are 100% worth the money.",0
340,"Everything fits right, but after the third Day the studs start to fall off",1
341,"No break in time, fits a little large but doesn’t really affect anything. The only problem is the studs break off",0
342,Really good cleat! They felt comfortable as soon as I put my foot in. They may run just a tad bit wide but other than that not bad at all definitely recommend!,1
343,Fits really good comfortable and fast shipping.,1
344,"If you are looking for cleat that gives you responsiveness on cuts as well as ball control. Look no further! I have been playing indoor in these bad boys for about a month now and I love how responsive my ball control is with the ultra sticky grip that covers the cleat. They are sleek, lightweight, and come in a great shade of textured black. The cleat fits true to size and is the perfect cleat for the masses. Check the grippy texture in the photo, it is a game changer.",1
345,"Coming from the first pair of flyknit mercurials I was a little hesitant on this cleat. The mercurials were amazingly light a quick but lacked a connection with the ball, but the Phantom changes all of that. The new knit materials as an extremely tacky coating combined with the 3D texture for a great touch on the ball. At first I was surprised how grippy they were but quickly adjusted after  a few",1
346,These boots are awesome. The gripknit feels great on the ball. I’ve only used these on turf so far and I liked the feel and traction provided. The only thing that I have to get used to is the spike pattern it is different than the mercurials I normally wear. The front has a circular pattern that feels different when sprinting. Not bad just different. The fit is solid slightly narrow but I went,1
347,"I've been wearing Nike cleats since the 8th grade and each new style is better than the last.  Nike continues to make strides forward with each new boot and these are no exception.  From the second I put these on I knew they were going to be incredible.  They fit extremely tight, so there is no worry about slippage or anything moving on you.  Luckily they came when I still had a few weeks",0
348,"I recently acquired the Nike Phantom GX II Elite FG Cleats and I couldn’t be any happier with my decision to do so. I have always used Nike cleats throughout my entire soccer career, with my favorites including the Mercurial and Magista  lines. I currently play soccer and train a minimum of five days a week. The Nike Phantom GX II Elite has been fantastic and is very comfortable straight from the",1
349,"The fit and feel of these are close to perfect. The shoe molds around your feet, making the fit feel amazing. I tried the first version, and these definitely are an upgrade. The blackout design looks stealthy and unique compared to all other colors. This is, for sure, the best color option to get. As I stated before, the feel of these shoes is perfect from day one. You don’t need a break in period",1
350,Pretty blown away by these cleats. I’ve been a traditional cleat wearer and opted to get with the times and I can see why people make the switch. For starters it feels like I’m wearing another pair of socks on my feet. The material of the cleat moves with your foot. I even arched my foot and the sole of the cleat took the contour of the bottom sole of my foot. I thought it was a little too much at,0
351,"First thing- I Love the look of these. Black on black is so clean, not super flashy and the quality does the talking. The fit is really tight, but not at all constricting or uncomfortable. The material on the uppers is great as it feels less gripping than the previous version. The ball doesn’t get caught up or stuck on your foot as much, but still offers a lot of control. The only complaint I",0
352,"The Phantom GX II’s are tailored for those who enjoy controlling the ball at their feet. The cleats are made of a unique fabric that is somewhat “sticky” that allows the ball to be controlled much easier. It does take some time to get used to but once you get the feel, you will find that passing and controlling are much easier. I really enjoyed the design especially the padding around the",1

The boot feels very light and flexible. Because of this, you must",1
354,"These cleats are excellent. A couple of things if you're deciding if they are worth the money...1. The fit on these is amazing. Feel like a glove on your foot. 2. Grip is exemplary.3.

They have a sleek design and a strong grip.They’re lightweight while providing a lot of support and giving you a lot of control over the ball.I have tested them in both wet and dry conditions and was pretty happy with the experience on both situations.They run true to size though on the smaller side, so I would recommend going with a slightly larger size if you are in between sizes.",1

Light ages better than those old leather cleats.They fit great right out of the box and the sticky uppers are great for touches. No blisters or heat spots - awesome. I haven't used them in a game yet, but they've felt great playing in the backyard with my son.They fit true to size, a little narrow at toe compared to my old ones, but that has to be expected with new cleats.",1
359,"These soccer boots are extremely light weight and comfortable.  They feel very stable on firm ground and provide the grip you need on the pitch.  I like the circular shape of the cleats, which makes pivoting on firm ground easier.  I would say they run a bit small, maybe a half size.

Some other indoor soccer cleats I have found to be a bit tight and uncomfortable while playing in them. However, these Zoom Vapor 16s gave me enough comfort and traction. Surprisingly, these cleats also worked on turf quit well and did not experience a lot of slippage compared to other indoor cleats I have tried in the past. Two thumbs up!!",1
377,The design of the Zoom Vapor 16 Pro Soccer Cleats is a very nice soccer cleat. The all black cleats with a hint of blue makes the shoe look elegant. The leather on the cleat feels comfortable and the mesh on the top is stretchy so I can stretch it as I put them on. I do wish the laces were a tad bit longer so they way they will stay tied. Also I’m a size 9.5 and they felt a little snug so I would,1
378,The zoom vapor 16 pro is very sleek and just slides onto the feet. Wearing the shoe feels like there is very minimal material between my feet and the ground.

I like the sock liner how they changed it to more of a low vs the previous versions that would cover my ankle.  The Achilles pad is a nice touch for increased comfort and snugness.  My foot doesn’t slip at all in these shoes.  I use to get some Achilles blisters with the older versions so the new pad at the heel I feel helps a lot.

The material feels incredibly light (better contact on the ball), yet durable—all while being made with at least 20% recycled materials.",1

Putting them on was not the worst, although opening up the tongue one more eyelet would make it feel more comfortable to slip on.

Once I used regular soccer socks instead of cushioned socks there shoe fit was better.",0
439,"This cleat has its highs and lows. At the end of the day, I can equate any issues to sizing, preference, and season.

Otherwise, these feel great on the pitch. The studs are versatile and work great on our summer game",1

One think I might say is to size up if you have a thicker foot for that comfort and great fit.,1

484,Wow never thought cleats would fit so good. I always had fear because i have wide feet but these fit perfect. The material is so light made me feel way faster and less tired through the game. Amazing color making an all black shoe so interesting. Only downside was putting it on. Because of my wide feet and shin the high model makes it tough to put on but once on it literally fits like a glove. Getting a low version is a must.,1
485,Used the cleats first time for practice and they felt really comfortable the inside was soft and did not have me any blisters. Second time I used the cleats for a game and the shoe fits perfectly with no slipping of the foot. The material feels thick and not thin. One thing I would change about this cleats is the heal it felt a bit tight on my feet. I love the color.,1
486,The Cleats are AMAZING! These cleats felt great and performed so well on the soccer field that I now wear them on the football field too.
