The look and colorway (Black/Light Bone) is classic and goes well with many of my daily outfits.

I would not recommend for any hikes or trail walking. They fit true to size and does give off that skateboard shoe vibe. The sock lining and cushion gives more of a comfortable feel than your typical jordan 4s. I love the color scheme that came with the design including the thicker padded shoelaces.

I appreciate that these feel like a remix of an iconic shoe with a little flair of their own.

They are much more like an old school skate shoe than an AJ. The materials were nice, they are made very well, but overall they are a little bulky and heavy. For anything more than an easy stroll they may not be the best pick. I think they will hold up, as they are very solid, which is nice.","The Air Jordan 4 rm gives you the style and comfort of Jordan and Air max.

It felt slightly tight, especially in terms of narrowness. I'm not sure if this is due to the shoe itself or if I didn't get the correct size. The feel was also just okay due to the narrow fit.

These shoes are way too nice to wear on a golf course. 😆 🤣 😂,"What a great pair of shoes! I wasn't sure if I was going to keep them. Once I took them out of the box, they came alive. I didn't have to try them on. I knew they were staying in my collection.","Loved these shoes but I wore them 5-6 times and one of the lace eyelets ripped out, I wish I swung hard enough for that to make sense. They gave me a full refund but now my size is sold out. Such a disappointment.","Have recently received my 3rd pair and could not be happier.  Uniqueness and attention to detail are “spot on!”  Only critique I have that I take exception to is the 14 day price protection plan.  Fourteen days is a very short period of time and an industry leader like Nike should protect its MEMBERS for at least a period of 90 days in the event of a website price drop.  I would still give the product an overall perfect rating, it’s solely a policy disagreement!","These are my second pair of Jordan golf shoes and am very happy with them.  What I like about the Jordan line is the lateral stability for someone like myself that has some foot issues.  Also they are very comfortable and aren't overly heavy.  Easy to walk the course in.  The waterproofing is also excellent, have played in wet conditions and all good.","Another great pair of golf shoes.  Fits well, comfortable and stylish",Good production Durable Color is good,"Overall a very nice shoe, good looking and quality... I do like how they stitched the tongue into the side of the show to hold it in place, but unfortunately with doing so, there is a part of the tongue that digs into the top of your foot making the shoes somewhat uncomfortable to wear.","Extremely comfortable, great fit, and they look awesome. I bought both colors.","Already played two rounds and shoes are extremely comfortable. Love the way they look and feel, well made. I will definitely buy the next color when they become available. Shoes are true to size. I highly recommend.",Might be the most comfortable ones yet. Will definitely buy next color released also.,"Light weight, great comfort and solid traction!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A must have in any Jordan collection!,I have issues with my feet swelling up and these mules make it so easy to put on,Perfect for before and after golf. And just to wear around the house.,"Nice slide. Runs large though, would go a 1/2 size down if you want a more snug fit",Love them. Easy to slide on and off and very stylish. First pair but will definitely be ordering again,5 stars the best comfortable and they look good,Bought these for my dad who has been struggling with back and knee issues and he's loved them so far.

I tried creasing them but it didnt crease, and I didnt use crease protectors.",Really love these shoes. Bought them as house shoes since I hate slippers.  They do run big and wish I had purchased a 1/2 size down. The reason they receive a 4 start is because the jordan golf logo peeled off the tongue. I've worn these primarily with shorts and only wore these outside to the mailbox and once when i forgot to change them before leaving the house.,"Really nice, very well made. The run huge. I normally wear a 12 and had to get these in a size 11.",very comfortable great looking excellent mule,Liking my new mulesVery comfortable for pre round and the 19th holeNot sure I would play golf in them Many compliments on them and would highly recommend,"These look cool on first visual, but looking down at them on my mrs’ lil feet… naa..Shes not really feeling them either.What i do think is cool is that it says golf, and if only tiger woods had his own brand like micheal jordan or if jordan had an alternative logo for any golf shoes a bit like lyle & scott with their green bird for the heritage and golf wear then yeah that would be proper cool!",These are the BEST! I wear them around the house. Easy on easy off....They look great and everyone complements me and askes where did get them! I grew up watching MJ and his brand has always spoke to me....Sometimes my age doesn't fit the current designs but these are right in my sweet spot.

The only,Very comfortable so easy to slip on and they look great walking around very convenient if you have to run out of your house real fast or wherever you're at can't say enough about them!!!,"Didn’t know what to expect with these. I’m a big fan of slides so wanted some go to sneakers. These are the best of both worlds. Super comfortable and solid fit. I’ve gotten lots of compliments, especially when people find out they slide on. I wear these everywhere, especially when I travel. Nike/Jordan should expand the line; these are a winner.",Absolutely love these. So comfy. Fit is spot on. They look so good up close.,Really enjoyed receiving this new addition to the Jordan Line today. Very cool slip on’s! Look forward to seeing additional releases in the future.,"I have the black and red.  Had my eyes on them before they were available for sale.  Purchased a pair for me the day that they could be purchased (before they sold out!).  Got the later option, the light blue, for the wife.

Great slip-ons, so you don't have to reach over and tie your shoes.",My favorite pair of Shlippas!!!,love these. so comfy and now my new gym shoes for leg day,"Didn’t. Know if I would like , but comfy and gonna be great to have when you want to go hit a few balls on the range … love it","Very comfy once broken in, needs about an hour or 2 of wear.

Very unique design that will receive compliments for sure. True to size.,I like these shoes very much. I wear them for everyday use. I get tons of compliments on these shoes. I think they would look better with laces but I the love the mule part of these. I loved the 17 mules just the same. Gotta love just slipping them on.,"I saw these shoes and loved the idea, ordered day of release and no way are these going back ! Really comfortable and the fit is true to size as I wear a UK 9.5 and the 10 was fine. Great looking with shorts … may not work for the knee high socks and brogues wearing members at my club lounge but for me that’s the icing on the cake ! Highly recommended.","Great look, ready for the 19th hole.",These are nice but run about a full size too big. Size down if they restock.,I just received my pair and am very happy with the look and quality of them! I wear a 12.5 in all Nike footwear but with these I was concerned the 12.5 would be too small but they are actually quite true to size. I have not yet worn them but am optimistic that they will wear great!,"I like these, I know they're getting a lot of hate but they're comfy and look great in hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Need a pair of Red,black and white retro 1 high top Jordan",I was initially worried about buying golf shoes but with a couple of wears I was confident in my purchase. The metallic green pops and being a AJ1 makes it’s won statement. Since this purchase I’ve picked up the burgundy and silver too.,These joints are Fire!!! I would buy a second pair,"I love the way they look and the fit of them. I was skeptical to get the leather pair because I have a suede pair and silk pair also, but the look just like the picture, thank you. I’m really starting to like Jordan 1’s",I love these golf shoes! Super comfortable and the baby blue looks great!,Like to see the Jordan 1 as a golf shoe,So in love.

The first time I wore them I kept receiving compliments.","Flashy, a little too flashy. The reflective green materials is not on the instep but all the green overlays. Understanding that this is a retro design, a little ergonomic update to the toe box and midsole would be appreciated. For future buyers, recommend 1/2 size smaller than usual i ordered my usual Size 11; way to big in every way.","Totally awesome, great materials and colorway!",Awesome colorway of an amazing shoe.  I was leery of the hightop  for golf but I didn't even notice. The sole feels a little flat and thin. I feel a lot of stuff from underneath,"Brought these for my grandson. He had never had air Jordans, he was so excite to have a pair. He is loving the !",Awesome Jordans and made great for golf.,"The look of these are amazing. UNC white toe is a timeless pair. Leather is above average, very pliable and soft. It actually makes the shoe seem a bit wider than normal Jordan 1's I have. It might be due to the golf variation, but as someone with a wide foot I couldn't be happier. I actually size swapped these M12 for a M11.5 (always wear a size 12 in normal Jordan 1 releases). I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and definitely wearing these on and off the course (mostly off)!",People are sleeping on these and will be completely disappointed if they don't get these. Best materials I have ever had on a Jordan 1!,Purchased them for my son and he just loves them.He said they are comfortable to be out in the golf course and it does pretty well on wet areas.,These are great for golf and for wearing around.  Except for the Travis pair the Jordan 1 Golf’s are easier to get for those of us who wear their shoes.,Me personally i like the air jordan 1 high and low  golf more than the regular air jordan 1. The waterproof features and the materials are outstanding. I feel that the golf version is a stronger made long last shoes than the originals. Gold MJ’s all day for me cant wait to get the UNC pair.,"Really beautiful sneakers, both for golf and casual wear. They do run at least a half size big, depending on your feet. Personally I tried a size 12, 11.5, and 11. For me the 11 was nice and snug, but not tight, so I kept the size 11 and glad that I did.","Super comfortable shoes. Very sharp looking. Good grip on the golf course in the wet northeast. Nike shoes never fail in the water proof department. I normally wear a size 12 in normal Nike sneakers, but golf shoes are way off. My Airmax 90G shoes are a 12.5. I read the reviews here which suggest they run big so I ordered both an 11.5 and and 11. The 11's fit perfectly and the 11.5's were","Very comfy shoes!! Good for both golf and normal use, which is nice:). but the color was VERY different than in the pictures, it’s more of a purple than a red, but i still am a fan of the color. Good shoes, definitely worth the price!",Much nicer than the air Jordan 1 mid. Which I very much dislike now that I tried these. One issue is the color beside that they are light weight and comfortable. It does run wide in the toe box but nothing annoying.,Love love love my favorite shoes,"I wear them at a restaurant and it does the trick and turns heads. They do run a half size larger in my opinion, so go .5 to 1 size smaller than you usually might. Take a punch from weather. Grips really well indoor and outdoor. Unknown for winter use.","They look incredible. Absolutely amazing. They just run big - at least a half size, maybe a full size.",Missed out last time but this time I got them !!!,Fantastic Golf Shoe! Good stability and comfort. Sizing is on par with regular AJ1’s.

Perfect fit and size for me and the design is awesome!,Love you color green true to size.  Definitely recommend t.,First set of high top golf shoes I’ve ever owned and I like them. The only negative is that they don’t have as much cushion as some of the other Nike golf or Jordan golf shoes. Definitely best worn when driving in a cart vs walking.,Jordan 1s always fit different and it’s very annoying. These run almost a full size big,"Awsome shoes! Love this colorway, can't wait to hit the course. Hole in One's.",Easily the nicest golf shoes I’ve ever owned.,"Great golf shoe, stylish and comfortable.  Purchasing directly from Nike is the best way to buy.","Love these shoes, they look great both on and off the course!",Super vibrant and beautiful white!  Can't go wrong!,"Delivery was spot on for my son’s birthday, he really loved it.",Quality id perfect,Beautiful shoe but make these none golf and they’ll sell out in 2 secs!!,great shoes!,Very comfortable! And beautiful,"The colorway is super simple and clean; however, the leather used feels a little worse than a normal pair of AJ1 highs; maybe it's designed that way to better prevent the water from getting in. It fits true to size and is very comfortable, just like a normal AJ1.One thing to notice is that they crease a lot in the front toe box.",Jordan 1s strikes again!  It is high top golf version.  very comfy but honestly going to wear it out more than on the course,I wear a 13  and All My Jordan 1  fit snug! This 13 fits like a 13.5 and im loving it! I wish all My J1 had room in the toe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately the toe area is a bit off compared to my usual air max shoes. The felt a little bit big in my normal size 12 so I exchanged for 11.5 and it fits perfect except the outer toe area is a bit snug now.
