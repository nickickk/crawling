조던 스피자이크 로우,지인추천으로 구매햇는데 상당히 이쁘네요..단 발볼넓으신분은 1사이즈업 추천합니다,"신발의 만듦새는 매우 좋습니다. 사이즈도 조던3, 에어포스 로우 기준 275사이즈를 신고, 다른 신발들은 280을 신는데 이 신발은 275가 딱 맞습니다. 다만 신발을 신기 위해 발을 넣으려면 정말 진땀을 빼야할 정도로 힘듦니다. 조금이라도 편하게 신고 벗고 하시려면 한 사이즈 더 크게 주문하세요. 오프라인 매장에 이 제품이 있는지 없는지 여부도 일일히 발품 팔기 어렵고 해서 온라인으로 주문했는데 오프라인에서 신어보고 구매를 결정했다면 더 좋았을 거 같네요. 가격도 그렇고 뭔가 살짝 아쉬운 느낌","설연휴 전이라 담주쯤 받겠지 했는데.. 오전 주문 후 다음날 오후에 도착했네요!저에겐 두번째 조던이고, 컬러가 맘에 들어서 조금 충동적으로 구매했습니다.다 좋은데.. 가운데 슈 잡아주는 빨간색 버튼디테일이 좀 아쉽네요.컨버스 270mm 신는데 같은 사이즈로 하니 딱 좋습니다. 발볼이 넓은 편인데 조금 두꺼운 양말 신는다면 살짝 타이트할 수 있겠네요.아무래도 기동성을 염두해서 그런지 안쪽이 두터운 편이에요. 조금 여유롭게 신고 싶으신 분은 평소보다 반치수 높이시길 권장합니다.","I absolutely love them, and at the last minute were the perfect shoe just in time for Homecoming Week .",They are nice and stylish to wear on a date out ye,My second pair .

He had never had air Jordans, he was so excite to have a pair. He is loving the !",Awesome Jordans and made great for golf.,"The look of these are amazing. UNC white toe is a timeless pair. Leather is above average, very pliable and soft. It actually makes the shoe seem a bit wider than normal Jordan 1's I have. It might be due to the golf variation, but as someone with a wide foot I couldn't be happier. I actually size swapped these M12 for a M11.5 (always wear a size 12 in normal Jordan 1 releases).

And beautiful,"The colorway is super simple and clean; however, the leather used feels a little worse than a normal pair of AJ1 highs; maybe it's designed that way to better prevent the water from getting in.

I needed a pair to wear for teaching and they do the job as fitting as a business causal shoe.,Better than expected!!! Got them for the color but they've quickly become my favorites!,"Very comfortable right out of the box. Casual enough for an every day wear, but dressy enough to pair with slacks and not have to wear dress shoes. The colors have a grandmother's couch vibe, but I wanted dressy-ish comfortable shoes and they're exactly that.",Super comfortable. Even cooler in hand. Stylish enough for a work business casual.,Very good shoe. ComfortableDurable,"Have the AMM version of these, they have knocked it out of the park on this Frankenstein model. One of the best to come down the pike.",Very comfortable fit. I love the style. These shoes can give a bit of a dress casual look when worn with khakis. They’re my fall go to shoes!,"Great shoe, good color, fits comfortable. Only thing negative if any, the tongue lays to the side when wearing but great shoe.",Want to wear a Jordan to work and not break dress code violations? Here it is!

I usually wear 6 but got 6.5 and it’s a little loose and makes my feet look really long but the color and design looks great,"Love the look of these, but they feel small and narrow on my feet. Always had a size 9 in Nike - but wish I had gone up a size for these shoes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
나이키 에어 모어 업템포 로우,별5개짜리 디자인인데뒷꿈치가 기존 업템포에 비해 많이 낮아서설렁하게 끈 묶으면걸을때 벗겨지네요하이탑이라 신고벗기 편하게 하려고 뒷꿈치쪽 낮춘거 같은데편의성을 위한 반영이라면 실패한 디자인인듯 해요더 불편합니다근데 그런 단점 감안 하더라도 신발이 너무 이뻐서저는 만족합니다,뒤꿈치가 좁고 걸을때 잘 버껴짐.뛰수가 없음.신발 디자인은 굿입니다.사이즈는 정사이즈 추천.,검흰 사이즈는 정사이즈화면상 AIR이 하얀색인줄 알았는데받아보니 실버색상 참고!이쁘고 기존 로우에서 AIR에 뻠핑된 느낌 굿!,I love the are more uptempo and the low for me is even better. They are clean and easy to style in the black and photon color. Can't wait to get the black on black with the gum soles. Wide footers go up half a size for your toe tips..,"The Nike Uptempo with its iconic design has always been a shoe that I liked. Usually wearing the high variant, I didn’t know how I was going to feel about the low variant. I can honestly say I like this shoe more due to it being lighter on my feet making it better for active wear and just running errands in it. Toe box isn’t tight on my feet which I really like. Also not too tight around the ankle","I wear these shoes daily and they fit so well! However, they are bulky by design, so there is some added weight. This design of the Air More Uptempo is a timeless classic and is always eye-catching. The fabric is easy to clean and stylish. These shoes turn heads and are so comfortable, the only thing I would change is the toecap, which seems unnecessarily big.","The Air More Uptempo Low is a striking sneaker that successfully merges style and comfort. Its bold design, characterized by the iconic ""AIR"" lettering on the sides, remains a standout feature, giving it a retro yet modern appeal.Comfort-wise, the shoe excels with its plush cushioning and supportive structure, making it ideal for both casual wear and light athletic activities. The low-cut","The Nike uptempo low is comfortable and stylish, the uptempo low hugs your feet with comfort although I would recommend going up half a size because I’m a size 12 and it feels a little tight at the tip of the toe. I would make the Air lettering a little smaller and not so bold because it is the first thing you notice when wearing them around. The design is beautiful work of art and reminds me when i watched Scottie pippen wearing the high version during his times in the NBA","Shoes fit true to size. They are basketball shoes so they will fit snug. If you like extra room, maybe consider sizing up. The shoes feel heavy and kind of clunky. I would not wear these for performance. The sole doesn’t allow for much flexing. The design is amazing. Super dope. I was a fan of the OG uptempo high, but I think the low is better looking! My friends think they are",This was the first time I bought shoes online and they are perfect. I love them,I paired the Nike Uptempo with an all black Nike Tech sweat suit for a stealth look. Typically I like this model in a mid top but was surprised at how good they looked in hand in low top. The overall quality of the sneaker is amazing ; the suede was flawless and the padded letter accents are a great edition to this sneaker. The oversized air sole is very fashionable and the shoes are very comfortable. Overall the design of the shoe & the color wave is what makes we want to wear them I’m happy.,"The Nike Air More Uptempo Low boasts a bold design that’s definitely a head-turner, though it’s not for everyone. If you’re into statement-making streetwear, this is a fantastic choice. I love how it blends high-flying basketball style with graffiti-inspired graphics for a unique flair.In terms of comfort, it’s decent but not the most cushioned shoe I’ve worn. The Air cushioning and padded","When it comes to basketball shoes, I like to read 3-5 reviews before purchasing. love how this shoe fits my foot. It feels comfortable walking and running when playing basketball. I even wore them for leg day in the gym and was surprised how comfortable my workout was. The design of the shoe definitely turns heads. It goes well with shorts and cargos. I’m a size 10 usually in most of my Nikes but","First of all I buy a lot of Nike products and Nike shoes. So here are my thoughts on the Nike Air More Uptempo Lows. So to begin, I got the black and silver ones. The silver “AIR” across a black shoe really pops. The lettering is a soft material. The design shows off the brand with a 3D style pop out lettering. Awesome style connecting the heel of the shoe from “AIR” on both sides of the shoe.","I walk. A LOT. So when I was getting ready to review the Nike Air More Uptempo Lows, I was apprehensive to how comfortable they would be considering I’d never wore a low cut basketball shoe as everyday wear. I was IMPRESSED. This may be the most comfortable shoe I’ve ever put my foot inside and I mean straight out the box. In my experience, a lot of low cut shoes have a tendency to need to be",Shoes are super comfortable like really good. Nice fabric and color combination. They run slightly big. Overall I like shoes a lot but not sure if I would get them because they make your foot look so big it is a bit too much.,After receiving these kicks I opened the box and was brought back to the 90s for some reason. They have a very nostalgic look. I tried them on and honestly they felt a little bulky at first and a little heavy. Wore them around the house for a couple days to break them in. I wasn’t in love with the way my heels felt in them but I did get used to it. They’re not the most flexible shoe out there.,The materials - I was surprised by the quality of the materials when I received the shoe - the online photos did not do the shoe justice. The fabric and leather seem high quality as does the stitching. Everything looks really clean. I like how there are little nike swooshes that are placed in different parts of the shoe but are done in a low key way. The only negative is that you can see some of,"A cool take on a classic model, but I feel like these low tops kind of miss the mark. They feel lightweight, but they’re also clunky to walk in. The laces need to be tied quite tight for them to feel like they won’t slip off, which makes the bow very large and unappealing since it sits at nearly the top of the tongue, covering the logo. Walking in them is okay, they aren’t as comfortable","Nostalgia hits hard with the Air More Uptempo Low. As a kid who grew up in the 1990’s, this sneaker brings back all the memories of one of my favorite eras of pro basketball as well as the boldness of 90’s style, with the oversized “AIR” text on the sides and its chunkier design. The gel swoosh accents, visible air units in the midsole, and reflective details just add to its fun and funky",I’m a major fan of the Nike Air More Uptempo 96 and I was skeptical of Nike doing a low top version but I’m glad to say my skepticism was not warranted. Sizing is true to size or what you would normally wear in Nike Basketball sneakers. Quality is good and comfort is what I usually expect from Nike basketball sneakers but where this particular sneaker shines is in the aesthetic department. Nike,"These shoes are very comfortable as are most Nike shoes, I did find that they have a weird height for low top shoes. They were in between mid and low top in my opinion so it sometimes would feel weird when I walked. Other than that they’re very stylish and modern and can easily be paired with any baggy jeans or joggers. The color scheme is great as it can be worn with many different fits. The","I was really excited to receive the new edition of the Uptempos as I loved that Scottie Pippen wore them when I was a kid. Materials are quality and the Air pocket underneath makes the shoes feel comfortable while walking. My issue with the shoes is they are a little bulky as they have a large presence especially for a low top. In addition, the toe box is smaller than most other Nikes so make sure","Too tight in the front, gets away from the materials that made the original uptempo so special.",These are nice and comfortable. Worth the price and I like the color scheme.,"Nice,looking,comfortable shoe. Satisfied with purchase.","Cool looking , lightweight , comfortable.  But these shoes slides off!!!  What a fail!!!  You should tie them on maximum like before basketball game. I am dissapointed",Big fan of the uptempo series which is why I’m giving this even 2-stars.  The quality of the shoe is not the greatest.  Paint is messy and glue marks are clearly visible.  Kinda disappointed based on the price,Shoe is wide which is not bad. My main problem is that the shoe slides off. You have tie them to keep them on. Definitely not the best purchase I have made. Most likely will be returning them.,My feet are big and wide.... I usually need shoes stretchers... These shoes fit perfect... No need for any of that .. And they are way cooler in person....I am size 14.... Worth the price....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
