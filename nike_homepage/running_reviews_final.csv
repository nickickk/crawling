Fully waterproof and very light.  Great grip for light to moderate trail use.  Fit is just right. Sometimes worn for every day use and walking - again, this shoe feels great","Very nice pair of trainers and very pleasing to the eye. My only drawback is the tightness and how narrow these trainers actual are. That said,  I have wide feet, I usually wear size 12, but purchased 13 for this set, and my feet felt very restricted and tight to the side and above. If you don't have wide feet, these trainers are perfect, however, for those of us with wider than normal feet, please do your  research, or consider an alternative option.","I wanted these to work, but like others are saying; where the tongue is attached to the gusset it cuts into the top of my foot. The toe box felt great as did the midsole, but I would never make through a walk. Why didn’t Nike make it a little looser or use an elastic material to allow stretch.",Shoes are nice and cushy at the bottom. Im size 11 but should have read the reviews about them being narrow and tight at the top.  My right pinky toe hurt from wearing this for an hour or so.,"Too cushy for a trail runner.  Always order 1/2 size larger in Nike Gortex. Last years model was a better shoe for trail running,  At least this new model, the laces stay tied.  if you like a cushy shoe this is great",My size is usually 6.5 UK. I start loving trail shoes since I've discovered Trail 4 version. I am very happy about them. I wanted to try trail 5 as an update so I found that UPPER IS VERRY NARROW.

Also love that Nike makes running shoes / trail running shoes not look hideous like the other major running shoe brands.  This would've easily been a 5 star review but after one 8 hike, there is a part of the front / toe that has already slightly come apart.  A bit disappointing but the shoes are so nice I will still continue to wear them.",These shoes are absolutely wonderful! I use them to golf/caddie and they are perfect for the mornings when the conditions can be a little wet. They have great traction so you will never slip. The toe boxes offer plenty of room unlike some other Nike models and the cushioning is second-to-none. I highly recommend these!,"The Nike Pegasus Trail 5 gtx have got to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The amount of cushion it provides is unreal, matched with superior ankle support, and you have the ultimate running shoe.

With a bonus of how","I’ve been thoroughly impressed with this trail shoe from the moment I first laced it up. I especially love the grip this shoe has even on rugged terrain.

The gore-tex upper gives it a tough look that looks ready to take on","Must say these are the first pair of Nike Pegasus shoes I’ve found super comfortable. They typically run more narrow than I would like BUT these trail 5 gtx even have more toe box room!

I think these","I got these for my boyfriend and I have a pair as well. And we both said how comfortable these shoes are. He wears them on a daily basis for everything, whether is running, walking, or running errands. He mentioned how cool they looked and how he liked the design of the shoe. Most super comfortable shoes aren’t the best looking but we both loved the fit and design of these. He said he would buy them again knowing how comfortable they are.","I love the design of the shoe , especially the small details in front of the shoe.

I love that this product has grip on the bottom of it . This will help you have more control when stopping . Helps deter sliding and falls .","Fit and Feel: The shoe is a tad narrow. I'd recommend sizing up .5 if you have a wide or flat foot. The construction of the shoe is amazing but this can be expected from the goretex pegasus line. Traction wise, these shoes are solid.

They maneuver in all terrains like it was meant for each one.I did a few miles each time and they","This runs narrow and since there's a tightly woven ripstop upper, there's also less give for any excess width you might need. I got a size 10, which is my typical Nike running shoe size, but I would've benefited from at least a half size up as sometimes I do wear 10.5 for shoes that I know to be narrower, especially given that I'd need the space when my foot swells on runs. One other complicating",I liked the shoe overall. It was felt like the shoes wrapped around my feet nicely to create a snug fit. They felt sturdy which I feel is good for running/hiking over terrain which is what I would use them for.I do feel the shoe could have more subtle decals. It was ok for this shoe but in other colors I think the shoe could be really “loud”.,"Shoe fit very nice.  For me I have wide feet and flat feet so I had to go .5 up.

After","The Nike Pegasus has been my go-to running shoe for nearly two decades. While I reserve dedicated lightweight race shoes for competitions, the Pegasus line remains my reliable training buddy, equipped with the technology, stability, and durability needed for hundreds of training miles. Recently, I've found the trail variant performs admirably off-road as well.This pair is my second","The Nike Pegagus Trail 5 GTX is a very comfortable trail runner thanks to the React foam. The addition of the GORE-TEX to the upper was not too restrictive although there was some slight tightness around the midfoot area. The updated mesh sock liner is a nice addition although it does lead to a little bit more heel slippage, which altogether was not too cumbersome when running. The sneaker is","I have another pair of Nike trail runners so I was interested in trying these out. Have to say, these are the best trail running shoes/boots I've ever had.

Also, the back of the shoe doesn't cut in to/rub the achilles, which I notice some trail running shoe/boots","Super lightweight, foam outsole is real soft and responsive, your feet doesn't sink in but it helps with putting a spring in your step. Great for if you're going on a hike or trail running. You can wear this around doing errands or getting groceries but the only thing is on the back of the heel the foam protrude a bit out so it may look a bit strange. But on the trails it's fine, I believe the design is to keep you stable and comfortable while going over uneven surfaces.","The Nike Pegasus Trail 5 GTX is a great functioning and looking shoe. At my first try on, the shoes fit very snug. I only needed to adjust the mid foot part of the laces and that solved the problem. The cushioning is very comfortable.

It makes me confident I won’t roll my ankle on rocky terrain or running down",My first impressions of the Nike Pegasus Trail 5 GTX was that they were stylish trail running/hiking shoes that would be great in muddy/wet conditions.

Thank you Nike for making  a perfect shoe.,"Wearing this pair of bots, I feel like a conditionally Formula 1 pilot, light, dynamic, manoeuvrable, flexible, stable, with all the necessary convenience and a sense of undeniable quality. In my opinion, the Zoom X midsole here works as an adaptive super rational car suspension. These shoes are so good that you don't want to wear any others. I want to express my great gratitude to the Nike company for the fact that this pair of bots elementary hit my taste.","If you loved the Pegasus 35 Turbo's or the Pegasus Turbo 2's, these are very similar.  They feel a little more cushioned than the older versions but have that snappy yet soft feel of the older Turbo shoes. Great upper on these.  An ideal shoe for longer runs, longer workouts, or road marathon/ ultra races if your body doesn't respond to plated options for the longer stuff.","These arrived very quickly after ordering in secure packaging. I bought them as a gift for my son for winning the Open Mile at the Meet the Dukes night.

Overall, it really supports my run, feels great, and has an awesome design!","I was looking for a new pair of shoes to use for my run club sessions and ended up trying out the Pegasus Plus. I was honestly surprised by how responsive they are! The shoe is pretty lightweight given the amount of cushioning and still very breathable.

Lightweight and feels walking on clouds!,"These are spot on; light, peppy and fun. A die hard fan of the Peg Turbo 2’s I’ve been in the wilderness finding something as good since they were discontinued.

I think they’re my favorite shoes I’ve ever owned.",Very comfortable with great cushioned midsole,"These might be the best iteration to date. I loved the v2 premium; v3 was similar but not quite as good. v4 took a little breaking in (maybe 50 miles), and now it is soft responsive perfection.

They fit and hug the feet really well, with plenty of room in the toe box. It's also highly cushioned to protect your joints.

I’m now looking for a new shoes….disappointed,"The Vomero 17 is a great shoe, and the cushioning is the best I've ever experienced. It's springy and they feel great to walk in. The arch support is amazing. These shoes cradle your feel and it feels like walking on a springy cloud. The only thing that would make these shoes perfect is if Nike lowers the ankle cutouts in future versions. There is a slight ankle rub on these compared to the Pegasus. Overall, these are like an improved Pegasus in every way except for the ankle cutout area.","Nice cushioned trainer. Does it’s job well. My feet and legs like them a lot. They’re slow, but they aren’t really meant to be fast. Great for high mileage runners. I’ve put about 270 miles on them and the foam will be packed out long before the tread wears away. They’re also a bit loud and “ploppy” which I attribute to the rubber being tougher than other offerings.",Got these for my wife. She says they’re comfy and likes the way they look.,"I have worn the Nike Pegasus most of my life.  However, I really like the Nike Vomero 17.  The cushion of the shoe is great and the fit is good.

I found the invincible 3 too unstable and the Pegasus too narrow for my foot. This shoe my perfect go to everyday.,"wow. These were my first pair of new running shoes in 3 years and the difference is incredible. I’m a heavy stepper and the bounce and cushion of these make my steps feel so light, they’re wide on the outsole and are super light, and they look good too! My runs are more enjoyable now 👍⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",I love these shoes!!!!! They are so comfortable I found myself adding extra miles to my usual walk. They are definitely my new favorite walking shoe.,"I want to love these shoes. I love the cushion. Nike finally brought it back, but why did you take away the midfoot stabilizer?! I don’t get it. This is needed for running and for really anything. I feel like my foot is swimming and not locked in like it should feel with all of the cushioning. Please bring back the mid foot stabilization of the 16s and keep the cushioning.","This might be the best running shoe Nike has ever made. It is extremely versatile!

My only issue is I wish Nike made more colorful options for this shoe in men's!",Not only do these shoes have a great aesthetic and amazing color choices but more importantly they are ahhhhmazing while running! They are so cushy and comfy with a nicely sized toe box and make running a breeze.,"The EVA foam acts as a rigid stability plate. I really didn’t feel much energy return from the  ZoomX foam. In concept it sounds great but something feels off, I was hoping the shoe would soften up after 30 miles. Also developed a hotspot in the outside of the right foot. Not wide foot friendly. Wanted to love this shoe.","Bought these because I got tired of waiting for the nike air zoom tempo next% flyknit to be restocked. Have run multiple 7, 9, and 20 mile runs at the same pace as with the tempos and really prefer the Tempos over the Vomeros. The Vomero is a much hotter shoe on my feet. I have only been running in below 40 degrees so not sure I'm going to use them when it gets warmer outside. The collar is soaked",Great shoe and the stack is crazy. Striding in these shoes are natural. It’s an amazing daily trainer.,I’ve ordered two pairs and the same thing happened within 39 minutes of just wearing them to the gym. Because the tread doesn’t come up the front of the shoe (like every other running shoe ever designed) the soft foam that runs around the shoe starts to tear and peel back. Outside of that it’s a comfortable shoe. Disappointed that they didn’t do this basic thing.,I like the vomero 16 better they are more stable. The 17 are good for walking not so much for running.,Completely different sneaker than the 16. In a good way! Cushioned like the invincible but with more stability! Plenty of cushion without taking away the spring /responsive feel !The laces have a bungee like feel which made it easy to get your foot locked in! Lacing system is perfect! No heel slippage ! Padding around the ankle is nice and plush. No rubbing on my achilles. Toe box has plenty of,My Favorite shoe ever!  It is the only tennis shoe I will buy! So comfortable and never hurts from day one.  Go run to get you a pair today!,"Not a fan of the new model compared to v16. The lock lace is very high and with the stitched in lace, the lock digs into the foot.","Excellent purchase, comfortable, supportive and durable","The perfect running shoe. It’s light, smooth, fits perfectly and feels like being on marshmallows. The cushioning, shock absorption and energy return is out of this world. Will be buying more pairs to put away.","Fantastic shoe, very comfortable. Needs to have one be in all-black color though.","I LOVE these sneakers. Can’t say enough great things about them. Very comfortable, lightweight, breathable material, and true to size. Always use them for my daily walks; never blistered or had sore feet breaking them in. Constantly complemented on them and happy to recommend.","Wow these sneakers are a 10/10! My daughter recommended these sneakers to help encourage me with my new years goal to walk everyday and add more movement to my normal weekly routine. Super comfortable, true to size, breathable materials, and they don’t feel heavy making my steps feel light with low impact on my feet and legs. These have been the only sneakers I grab for since purchasing!","I’ve really enjoyed these shoes. They are more responsive and less cushioned than the Pegasus. Im a big fan of the springiness. I never liked a lot of cushioning, and these have just enough me. They are great for plyos, sprints, and short runs. If I still ran long distance Id imagine they’d be fine for 5 miles or more.","This is hands down the comfiest shoe I have ever put on, I also like the way the the bottom of the shoe has really great grip, perfect do it all shoe",I will be honest.. I do not ever pay this much for shoes! These shoes are like walking on a heavenly cloud of delightfulness!! They fit perfect! Not too tight (I have a wider foot) and not too loose. The support is perfect. The insole isn’t glued in like most shoes so if you need to swap out it’s easy. They also washed up really well after I got some mud on them. They are truly amazing shoes and,"I have used vomeros for many years. I think Vomero 17 is the most comfortable and the one that offers the best support for daily use since Vomero 13, which was my favorite. I bought two pairs, green and blue. I am very satisfied with my purchase.","I’ve run 90 miles in these, in the month that I’ve owned them. I alternate these with the Invincible 3s. More often than not, these are my go tos. They’re exceptionally responsive, fit perfectly, and are amazingly durable. Probably my favorite running shoe to date.",Got these for my mom. She normally wears 9.5wide in womens. These fit perfectly. She says they are very comfortable. They look nice too.,"I just purchased these shoes the other day at my local running store and have put around 25 miles into them. I am coming from the Pegasus 39 that I purchased in June 2022 I believe. These shoes feel amazing and bouncy in all the right ways. The ZoomX technology incorporated into the shoe feels great, and I enjoy using these as a daily trainer. $160 does feel a little steep, however, but I do",This shoe is very comfortable and fits true to size. It feels really easy to put on and off and is effortless to wear all day long. This is my go to pair of walking and running shoes,The fit is true to size and feel of these sneakers is great. They feel like walking on clouds! They look good with athleisure for running errands and at the gym. I love the stretch these offer for those of us with wider feet. I would love these in neutral colorway.,Big improvement. The full length zoomx makes a big difference from the previous version of the vomero. It’s like an invincible with more stability and forefoot space.,From the first time I put these on the cushion and comfortability was noticeable. I have issues with bad heels and plantar fasciitis and my feet felt supported and less painful in these than other running shoes.,Love them! The color is as pictured and they’re super comfortable. Ran my first miles in them today and they did not disappoint! I’ve been running in Pegasus for a while but wanted a change and I’m glad I went for these.,I love these shoes..super comfortable and worth the price.,"Design as always is nice, however, the Vomero as I knew it, is dead.  These fit completely different than before, they feel as if you’re falling to the outside of your heel…just completely different.  I won’t be buying any other Vomeros and I’ve been buying them since the vomero 3’s",This shoe is one I had seen on YouTube and wanted to get. The shoe honestly fit like a glove true to size. It was like walking on clouds and you can tell a HUGE different from one shoe style to thins one. The design is perfect for walking and being on your feet. Lightweight. Bouncy. Has some give. The fabric is breathable which is nice because let’s face it leather shoes have no air circulation.,Wearing the Nike Vomero 17 was such a comforting experience. I was able to wear these shoes consecutively for a couple of days and not experience any foot pain. I like the color of the shoes and they didn’t get dirty despite the color tones being very light.,Best trainer Nike has. Best fit. A lot more stability than most trainers. ZoomX and cushlon work well for a cushy and durable trainer. My go-to shoe already,"OKAYYYY girlies—WHERE do I begin with these shoes?? Nike’s running shoes just seem to be getting better and better. I have really high arches so I struggle to find CUTE shoes that give my foot enough support, but the comfort of these are NEXT level, 10 out of 10 and the style and colors are SO cute. The outsole is slightly thicker than the Pegasus running shoe, for reference, but still don’t look",The Vomero 17 was a really great experience. The zoomX midsole and removal of the air unit provided a really great feeling. I used the shoe for a multitude of runs ranging from speed work to easy runs. The shoe performed really well for all of these. The 10mm drop/more aggressive rockered midsole provided an ease in the stride regardless of paces. I also used the shoe on a variety,"The Nike Vomero 17 was an interesting shoe for me. Super plushy, comfortable yet firm soles. Great for running. Used these shoes in the gym and for everyday activity with such comfort, and ease. The only thing I did not like was how the cloth material “dimples up” near the toe area. Besides that, the shoe is really solid.","These shoes are so cute, they have understated colors so you can enhance them or mute them which I love! They feel like you are walking on clouds! Very “bouncy” and ease of movement. Wore them all day at the State Fair and I cannot complain!!! Definitely recommend if you are an avid walker or a short runner(beginner) like me, so comfortable!","I’ve never had a shoe fit as well and feel as comfortable as these do! As soon as I put them on I didn’t want to take them off, with my other shoes there’s usually a feeling of them being a little too narrow/wide/extra room by the toe etc, but these are perfect for my feet. I don’t have very wide feet either but for the people that do they have the wide sizing for you too! The design is very sleek","The Nike Vomero 17 is a new style of sneaker for me. And one that’s quickly becoming a favorite. I believe that the Nike Vomero 17 is perfect for daily trainings or long runs. The mesh lining makes it feel breathable and flexible. The Vomero 17 is super comfortable. I specially like the plush, bounce back feel that I assume comes from the technology of the zoom x midsole. If I had to change anything about the Vomero 17’s it would be to make them a bit more lightweight.","I was a little skeptical trying these because I’m not usually a vomero girl and the orange color was a little bright for me but after having these on my feet for just one minute, i am totally convinced that these are the most comfortable shoes i have ever put on! I’m able to walk around in these for hours with no pain and have truly enjoyed wearing them anytime i can. They are soooooo beyond comfortable and i feel so supported while having these on my feet. I’m officially a vomero girly now!","These Vomero 17's are the move if you're looking for comfort and style. I am not a runner by any means, but I'm pretty confident they would be excellent for a jog. There is a little bounce with every step, they're lightweight and extra breathable. I normally shy from mostly white sneakers, but the touches of black and bright orange made for a perfect fall look.","This shoe is very comfortable out of the box. It is wider than the react and not as bulky as the structures. The fit is perfect for me, they don't feel loose or squishy like other cushion shoes.  Overall is a great looking shoe with high quality finish.","First, this shoe is very nice. I got so many compliments on it. At first, the shoe was a little tight. It took awhile to break in. The toe box was a little tight for me. I don’t think sizing up would have made too much of a difference. But after a few wears the shoe fit pretty good. I wore them for short runs, since they still were a little too tight on the toes I didn’t want to risk wearing them on longer runs. Not my favorite Nike shoe but still pretty decent.",The Nike vomero 17 has easily become one of my daily drivers when I’m either running or just casual walking. It’s very comfortable and light. Wear it a few times to break it in. It fits true to size so it’s snug on my feet.,"w nike vomero 17… where do I start welp when I first got the shoes I didn’t expect anything to be different from the way it looks, bold colors and slim you know just a overall basic running shoe, but nope this nike vomero 17Really feels like your on cloud 9, this shoe not only feels Airy it’s also on great on bounce, this shoe had me feeling extra light on my feet, gaining the confidence as if I could conquer anything !!","These shoes are extremely lightweight and comfortable. I can definitely wear them everyday from going to the gym, lounging around after the gym, to running my daily errands. I have flat feet and these didn’t hurt my feet after a long day of walking.",My husband has been loving these updated Vomeros. He says they are true to size and felt so comfortable even on the first run. The cushioning is perfect and not too bulky. No need to break them in which is a huge plus. The material feels more durable than other shoes we’ve tried for running and they’re also not as heavy. Overall the fit and style is great and he’s going to continue using them on his long runs!,"Pleasantly surprised with the comfort and support these sneakers provide. Their cushioning is superb and this keeps your feet in the most comfortable and supported position as you run or walk.

My usual size fit perfectly, definitely true to size.",Omg!!! So i usually go for the Nike waffles to work out in but i tried these and they were so comfy. Felt like i was walking on clouds. They are true to size and very spacious. Mind you these are very lightweight so perfect for running because feels like Ntn is on your feet but cushion. The style of the shoe is very fashionable so doesn’t look like your average running shoe. These could also be used for basketball if you enjoy playing pick up games.,The cushion on these bad boys are insane!!! SO COMFORTABLE!!! I love to walk and I have put some miles on these shoes! I was incredibly impressed with the bounce and comfort of them! They still feel comfortable after one mile which I love and something I look for in a shoe! I have extremely wide thick feet (4E) and these fit with thin (I only own thin due to wide feet) socks! The width of them is,Wanted to get a pair of shoes that I could wear when working since I’m typically on my feet for 8-12 hours a day and on pavement as I’m in sales. The Vomero was perfect for that. They provided great cushioning and support for those long days when I spend going back and forth assisting different customers and I’m glad I made the choice to try these. I’ve tried other Nike runners in the past for,"This sneaker was super comfortable and lightweight. I’m a fan of the thicker sole; almost giving my steps a bounce to them. I definitely feel that the sole being thick but bouncy takes a good amount of impact from my step. Making for a more comfortable walk/run. A very breathable sneaker; not sure of the material used but almost like a breathable mesh, still giving great support to my foot. I","I love these - great running shoe with a comfortable fit that provides fantastic stability and support for all activities like running, walking, and every day errands. The ZoomX cushion feels great and makes these shoes super comfy for longer runs. These also feel more durable than other running shoes I have previously owned which makes these the perfect running shoe! I also appreciate the sleek and stylish look and I really like the grey, black, and neon color way.","I’ve only ever worn Nike sneakers in my adulthood so I’m well versed in them, these may be the most comfortable pair I’ve ever purchased. They provide support while being lightweight. I wore them on a recent trip to florida where we were walking 20000 steps a day and came back to our hotel feeling great. We got caught in a rainstorm and they did dry quickly. They are true to size. As far as looks go, they aren’t the most fashionable Nike shoe by far, but they do the trick.","To be fully transparent, my go-to shoes are the Nike VaporMax Plus or the Flyknits. I love how comfortable and multifunctional they are given I can literally wear them to the gym or a casual day out while the array of fun color options makes them all the more versatile.With that said, this is my first pair of Nike Vomeros. Based on looks alone, this style of shoe probably would not be my",Upon putting these shoes on it was immediate comfort.  They run true to size and the fit is perfect. I love how each step is just pure comfort.  I’m hoping that in the long run it holds up with it.   The shoes are very light weight and so far when wearing them for brisk jogs on concrete they feel great.  My next test will be on the treadmill which I’m sure will feel even better.  The design and,"I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Nike Vomero 17, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. These shoes tick all the boxes when it comes to comfort, fit, style, and versatility, making them a standout choice for both running and daily wear.Perfect Fit:One of the first things that struck me about the Nike Vomero 17 was how perfectly they fit. Nike's attention to detail","The Nike Vomero 17 are awesome! Great for a run or just everyday wear. These are very comfortable, for example. I wore basketball shoes for 8 hours popped on the Vomero 17 right after and immediately felt like I was wearing slippers. These have a very forgiving sole with the Zoomx taking road impact well. The footbed is also very contouring and comfortable. No soreness afterwards and the breathable mesh is terrific. I will definitely revisit the Vomero line in the future!","I recently just got back into running and these shoes are great! These shoes are lightweight and I usually need a wider shoe, but these provided a more molded fit to my feet allowing me to run without any pain or irritation! The design and fabric were perfect as it allowed my feet to not get too hot and sweaty.  The soft cushioning on the inside allowed me to have more support when I ran which I","My husband is absolutely enthralled with the Nike Vomero 17s, they have been a game-changer for my physical training exercises.

The cushioning is just right, providing enough support without feeling too bulky. This is","The Nike Vomero 17 is one of the most comfortable shoes for exercising, walking, and wearing for long periods of time. The design is lightweight but offers a ton of arch support and a very cushioned sole. I felt like I was walking on a cloud and would highly recommend this shoe.","The Nike Vomero 17 is a stylish and comfortable casual running shoe which could double as an everyday sneaker if you’re on the go or don’t like to coordinate your outfit to every shoe. Immediately upon slipping your foot into the shoe, you can feel the cushion and high responsiveness in the heel. There’s a clear sense of added padding, and the compression/spring in every step. Further the","Overall, I really liked this product. It felt like running on bouncy clouds, very cushiony. I would prefer a little bit more arch support, my calves felt like they fatigued faster in these shoes than my normal shoes. The tongue is too poky on the two corners, those could be rounded a little more. Fit true to size. I really liked the overall look look and design of the shoe, good color scheme, can go with a lot of outfits.",Man is this shoe comfortable. Feels like you are walking on comfy pillows. The materials are nice and airy. Design is nice and slick. Not too wide and not too narrow. Nice minimalist look with not a lot of branding. Good for long walks and for hitting the gym. Wouldn't change anything about it. Might even get me a black pair.,"Husband liked the shoes, he tackled the garage and did some heavy yard work in them. They held up well and still look great. Comfortable shoes and look great with sweats. He did mention the toe bubbles a bit but not super noticeable unless you are really looking at the shoe.","I’ve really been enjoying this shoe for everything from my daily walks with the dog to my nightly jogs. Even while walking, the sole is extremely responsive and it really gives the feel that the shoe is working with you not against you.

I’m going to order another pair.",Wow. I wish I knew about these long ago. I have type 1 diabetes and my feet are very important. These are so very light and even more comfy. I been wasting money on all different kinds of air max and every pair weighs a ton. These are perfect. The only thing that could be better is more color options. I want more,"Really love these trainers. I previously had the Nike Air Zoom Structures from 2021, which unfortunately a hole rubbed through on the heel. These are just as good - they are so comfortable, with proper arch support (good for someone like me with flat feet!) and I feel like I'm being propelled forward when I run. They are perhaps a little on the large side, and maybe a bit thin under the toe, but overall I love them and I actually look forward to running.","WOW!This is the Nike running shoe I have been waiting for since they stopped making the Equalon 3!!!Thank you Nike, you have finally cracked it...this shoe looks ace and feels like it is actually made for an 80kg man in his 50's like me...I've had two runs in to so far and have actually enjoyed running for the first time in a couple of years.Running shoes are not made for","Great shoe, very comfortable.. Butt they don't last long at all .. Soles start making a squeaking nose, and can now also feel the heal area when wearing them .Usually swear by nike trainers but the last 3 pairs I've bought they all make the dreaded squeak 🙈","Structure has always been my favorite shoe, and I buy several each year, but 25 is lacking. Thankfully the interior is as expected, though sizing seems a little smaller than usual. There are two style elements that I’m not a fan of. First, the shiny edge around the bottom. It just looks dated. But my least favorite is the fuzzy-type fabric around the back. It acts like a lint collector and I’m constantly picking off fuzz from who knows where.","I wore these shoes for over a decade, getting atleast a new pair every year and they worked well for me.  They stopped providing EEs and I quit and thought I would try them again.  They seem to be OK but I haven't taken them for a spin yet.","Please go back to the ""non sustainable"" structures.  The first pair in black felt too loose, returned. Bought the non sustainable, and they were pretty good, not as good as 24s, but pretty good.  Then they were out of the non sustainable so I got sustainable again.  This time they felt great.  But on the 4th run, the bottom started falling off.

Great buy and will definitely be getting another pair in the future.,"Great shoe for long runs and super supportive! However, it’s a bit of a boring shoe to look at. Please make them in more exciting colourways.","I must have bought easily more that 20 pairs of structures over the years (usually 2-4 pairs annually). This version I am disappointed in. Still same foot support but two big differences from my earlier versions - the tongue is different and I’ve not quite figured out what - it seems flimsier, not as big, not as cushioning. And the shoe laces are terrible - double knotted and they still come","First off, this shoe is very comfortable and I thought I had finally found the answer to my blister problem. I did have to replace the laces with some that would stay tied, but not a huge deal. What is a huge deal is that, after running in them less than 2 months the tread is coming off the bottom. I'm not a marathon runner, just trying to stay active in my 50's so I didn't run the tread right off. Money wasted and back to the drawing board",Comfortable right out of the box! True to size and feel like a great quality product! I only will wear structures!,"The quality of this trainer is excellent as always... I have used nike Structure trainers for a long time, and the support etc is all great. However when you are spending over £100 on a pair of trainers is it too much to ask to expect the laces to stay done up!!! Nike have changed the style of the laces to a silky material. I cant even run 1 mile with out them coming undone! Not ideal unfortunately!","I'm a 'sneakerhead' and bought these purely for running as Air Max (my go to) don't really provide the support needed when running. These are really comfortable and appear to be very well made. They are very cushioning, and have a large contact area meaning you're less likely to fall over.","Really comfy as all my Nikes have been, bought for holiday rather than fitness but look great",I usually wear New Balance for my training & Nike Pegasus for my races; but this is a very good shoe.  I've been a runner for 45 years and I'm 55 now.  This is a wonderful shoe since I got Plantar Fasciitis (PF) - very supportive and cushioned.  I would probably welcome a combination of ZoomX and Air Zoom.  All big firms should start advertising their shoes for cases related to PF as this would be very helpful for us.,"Great comfort shoe , walk 10hrs a day , no pain or soreness anywhere..Best shoe for walking I have EVER had bar none and I work in a shoe wearhouse.","Finally! A pair of trainers that fit my wide feet with a bit of room to spare around the widest part of my foot. I also have high arches and no problem there either. Slight disappointment in length of laces but that's the style these days I guess. Please keep making these trainers, they're great!","I've owned many generations of this shoe. It's the best ""stability"" shoe by far. I order a half size up to fit orthotics.","As somebody with a wider toe box & needing a lot of arch support, I have always struggled to find a shoe that helped both. I was previously running in the Nike Structure 24 & though I loved the arch support, I continued experiencing uncomfortable rubbing with my toes. I decided to get the 25’s in Wide width & CANNOT recommend it enough! I wish I had switched over to a wide width shoe a long time",This shoe is very comfortable. It’s true to fit. I am disappointed with the laces. They are very smooth and the shoes comes untied all the time. I feel like I’m tying my shoes all day.,Great sneaker. I’ve been wearing structures models for years. These feel good and the sizing is good. I like the oversized feel. The only thing I would change is the tongue to make it gusseted.,Bought them 2 months ago and have done over 300km in them and they are still as comfortable as the 1st time I wore them.,"I have narrow feet so finding the right shoe isn't easy, especially for high mileage. These work for me, especially since I pronate. I have found they feel the best with thin, tight fitting socks.",There’s something off on the sizing compared to previous versions.  They seem to be overly wide.,"These shoes are so comfortable & springy & responsive. They feel good, look good & perform well. I went for these with a bit of arch support due to a recent knee arthroscopy & they definitely help. Also lots of people asking where I purchased them from.","I have been wearing the Nike Structure models for over twenty years. I usually buy multiple pairs of every model. Except 21 and 22 only got one pair, did not care for those. The 23 and 24 were great, had many pairs. Waited extra long for the Structure 25. I am sorry to say it needs improvement. Nike should of continued with the gusseted tongue like  most of the previous Structure models. Also the","Upper is fine, but midsole cushioning is ' dead ', there is no energy return and it's very firm.

I love wearing these to run!",A few days after the shoes arrived we left for a family vacation so I have not been able to fully test out the shoes running.  Perfect shoe fit. I also really liked the black color. The shoe tips your foot forward a bit which gives an excellent sensation that one could take off any second. The soles of the shoe have tiny little bead like bumps which creates an interesting feel while walking. I am,"What a great shoot! The fit is very actual to the size which was awesome. The feel was very comfortable for a walking shoe, but for running it provided great support and cushion. I really am impressed with the shoe. I liked the design of the shoes as it was modern yet basic with the emphasis on Nike. The fabric had multiple fabric differences, which was nice visually. I liked, especially how the","I absolutely love the fit and support of these shoes. They are evenly balanced between the outside and arch, giving me the support I need to not put too much pressure on the inside of my foot. I also have wider than average feet, and these shoes are giving enough that they didn’t have to stretch out from wearing a few times to be comfortable. They were perfectly comfortable from the moment I put","This is a beautiful pair of running shoes. I audibly gasped when I opened the box. The mesh outside allows for breathability, and I am a huge fan of the white/dark smoke gray color way. When I put the shoes on I noticed how comfortable they were and I felt like they had good support; however that was overshadowed pretty quickly when I noticed that my toes ran right up to the front of the toe box.","This shoe is good both for running and wearing daily. It's now my go-to for everyday wear. In terms of design, the black version is pretty neutral, which I appreciate. While it's simple overall, there are subtle design elements that add some sophistication like the varied fabric choices around the heel and lacing and the lighter accents in the forefoot that also add support.

The durability is impressive too; they've held up perfectly after miles upon miles of use. Five stars all the way!",The Nike Interact Run is a light weight short to mid-range trainer that’s a perfect go between Nike’s more expensive ultra running shoes and basic trainers. As soon as you put on the Interact Run you realize how lightweight they are. The soft foam cushioning provides a pillow like feel that’s great for mid-distance runs. The lacing provides just enough structure around my ankle to prevent rolling,"These are better than I expected. I typically only like free runs and react running shoes, but these surprised me. Comfortable, stable base and good traction. Great shoe for the price.","These shoes are very comfortable and give me much support during my runs. I usually strength train and wear more of a training shoe, but I have been adding in some cardio (short distances) and wanted a pair of good running shoes. These shoes are perfect! Not only do they provide support they have a good size toe box. They hug the top of my foot which I like a lot. The shoe does not slide/rub back","I really enjoyed using this product. The shoe was amazingly lightweight and comfortable, which I loved, and it enabled me to not have any pain in my feet after substantial use whether inside or outside. I also liked the overall look of the shoe, which is a major plus considering most people that buy shoes for the purpose of them being comfortable don’t care about look.

It's a solid choice for runners seeking a reliable and stylish option.",These shoes are actually amazing!!!

When they are tied it is hard to come out of the shoe because of the ankle support.  The upper is super breathable and keeps your foot nice and comfortable. The,"These shoes are a true game-changer when it comes to comfort and lightweight design. I was amazed by just how light they felt. It's like wearing a feather on your feet! The lightweight construction makes every step effortless and minimizes fatigue during extended wear. Comfort is where these shoes truly shine. The cushioning inside is plush and responsive, providing excellent support",These Nike interact run were great. I ordered them for my son to wear to school and expect them to hold up well. He says they are comfortable and I have not noticed any wear yet. The upper is flyknit material so it will be breathable. The bottom looks to have traction similar to Nike Pegasus. The other guys in my household loved the look of the black and white shoe. A lot of the details on the shoe looks to be reflective which is a plus with fall and winter coming up for any runner.,"This is the next best running shoe. Extremely comfortable with plenty of cushion in the heel. Lightweight so it felt like I was running on clouds. I wasn't worried about blisters or friction because the shoe felt snug, but not too tight. Size was true to advertised. Love the QR interact capability and can't wait to try it out more. Loved the color scheme and goes with pretty much any outfit. Soft, comfortable, yet durable. Would get time and time again.",This shows was so comfortable my mom wanted them! I was able to walk after work in them and they were so comfortable. They are not my usual aesthetic however they get the job done. Helped me still have comfort after a busy day on my feet. Shoes ran true to fit. I usually wear no socks for some reference.,These sneakers are lightweight and ultra comfortable. I feel like the design give the shoe a smooth look yet edgy look that I absolutely adore. I now wear these shoes everyday because the knit upper is so comfortable and allows great airflow. The fit is a lil snug so I recommend a half size up for wide feet but worked great for me. What I liked the most about this sneaker is that they used recycled materials to make them and the quality and comfort is unmatched.,"These shoes are so comfortable!! Feels like I am walking in clouds, looking forward to wearing them for a run!",I was very impressed when I opened up the box to the Nike interact run. Very stylish shoes. The color combination on these shoes are perfect. The small details like the orange Nike swoosh is very eye catching. I really loved the knit material on these shoes. Upon trying the Nike interact run shoes they feel very comfortable. The support the shoe has feels amazing. I was a little hesitant about,I've trained and ran in these shoes and they work for both settings ! Long run (10 miles) and my feet were still feeling good. Shoe offers a lot of support and are breathable.,These shoes are being worn by my wife she loves them. She works as a nurse and is in her feet sometimes for 10-12 hours a shift. She also uses them for daily use and loves how they look and feel.,Comfortable shoe with great stabilization in the heel. Nice wide heel base provides support and stabilization while running. Very comfortable so gar. Toe box is on the smaller side so size up for extra toe room.,Ready set mesh. When your foot meets the floor you want to have the best comfort moving forward. This amazing shoe brings comfort to take on the greatest adventure. Whether it’s Crossing bridges or traveling across the country the foam like material and high arching sole centers its attention to soften each striking impact.,i really enjoyed wearing these shoes. Some days out of the week I’m out the house for more than 16 hours. I put these to the test one of these days from work to dance rehearsal. Im also a nurse and am on my feet all day. And i felt great at the end of it. They’re super light and really comfortable on my feet with good support at the heel. These are in my weekly rotation.,"Let me start by saying that the first thing I noticed was how light weight this shoes are. The materials are soft, breathable and best of all flexible! I wear them on both the treadmill and pavement, they have held up well. They really are a joy to run in. I do love the pop of orange color, adds a little style to my workouts. They have quickly become my go to workout shoes too! They look really","I wore these shoes for a lifting workout, a boxing class, and for a run. They have great support and are very thin and breathable. The sole of the shoe would work well for running outdoors because it is hard on the bottom, but I only ran on the treadmill and they worked great! The QR code on the tongue of the shoe was very cool to scan to show the sustainability project, but didn't look as",This shoe makes a perfect casual and everyday walking and jogging shoe. The upper is breathable and the design is fresh and allows for a neutral shape on the foot.  The foam is supportive but allows for cushion and comfort with every step. The Nike Interact is a versatile and sturdy shoe for daily use.,"After using the Women's Nike Interact Run for a week, I've found myself genuinely impressed. The shoe's upper flyknit mesh material stands out for its breathability. As a regular runner, this design significantly enhances comfort during runs, particularly when it comes to ensuring feet remain cool. This shoe securely envelops my feet, yet the flexibility in areas like the toe cap is commendable,",I love this shoe. It is so comfortable. You can workout with support. The shoe is lightweight. I love the color. It fits snug and comfortable.,"Having worn the shoe, the initial reaction was that they look chunky. The bottoms are too spongy with not enough support. The on foot feel is soft and comfortable, and walking around is comfortable. If any amount of pace is added, the bottoms give and don’t allow for solid balance. The upper is comfortable and fits the foot well, molding nicely and creating a comfortable hold.",I liked these sneakers they are a great colorway and they are very comfortable. I do wish the heel wasn’t as big so it could be cross between a sporty and streetwear look. Definitely will be using only for exercise,These shoes are pretty comfortable. I don't see the material around the from near the toes lasting long. Especially for women who get acrylic during their pedicures. It seens too thin and would rip after multiple runs.,"My w nike interact run are great running sneakers! I have worn them running errands, to work where I am on my feet all day, to workout and to go on long runs. Not once have I got blisters, had my feet hurting or had any problems with these sneakers. Right away they were very comfortable. I love how light they are! They also go with everything!","Upon opening the box I was prepared to hate these but gave them a try… and AND I LOVE THEM! They are super light, yet cushy and supportive. My foot is on the wider side of normal and these fit perfectly. I prefer a more stable shoe and thought there was no way these could be stable since they’re so light, but somehow Nike made it happen! The fly knit around the ankle didn’t rub my heel and they’re",

However, just my thoughts,  I wear a size 12 with a wude foot, but 12.5 fit just fine.  Again just my thoughts maybe go up a half size.  It's a good shoe.","Had quite a few compliments over these (Smokey Blue colour). Very comfortable and work well on slippy hills. Have a very grippy sole, tested on steep muddy declines and the grip was insane.","You definitely have to buy at least two size up from whatever size you wear because, I'm a 13 but brought a 14 to make sure I had enough room. My big hit the very top with the 14 so I have to exchange them for 15, hopefully this size fit well other than that I like the sneakers.","This one is my new all time favorite trail running shoe. The Nike Zegama 2 is just the right balance of comfort, softness and that ZoomX bouncy responsive fun. The Vibram outsole has great grip, The midsole is protective, flexible, and comfortable while maintaining enough stability to handle rough terrain. They are more nimble and comfortable than my Calderas.",I got a free pair of these shoes at Western states 100. They were giving them out to all the runners. I like the feel and the traction of the shoe but the quality is very poor. I had less than 50 miles on them and the sole separated from the upper. Maybe I got a bad pair but I also had the same issue with a pair of Nike Wildhorse. The pair of wildhorse probably 100 miles on them. I have sent back,"These shoes are so comfortable. I was hesitant because the sole is so thick, I thought they would be too soft. Not the case! They have enough return to keep you from sinking into the sole when you are standing still. I would love for Nike to come out with some darker colors so I could wear these to work.","Bought these shoes for a trail Half marathon and I absolutely love the foot feel and vibrant sole. However after and a month of training in the park these and the half marathon the are falling apart! The top midsole layer has ripped easily, the trail logo on the sides are already peeling and the stitching is already coming apart. I would love to use these on longer runs but I can’t trust them.",Love the style. Love the fit. Very comfortable. They are my new favorite shoes.,"Really nice shoe. Great foam, very good traction and all round good fit for me. A pleasure to run in and I suspect will become my go to shoe now that Hoka has messed up the Speedgoat with version 6. My only gripe is the lacing system which doesn’t have enough friction in the eyelets to dial-in the fit across different parts of the foot. A few more color options that aren’t white would be nice too.","So far, I love these!!! I am a huge fan of the Nike ZoomX Invincible 1 and 2 for road & track running so I have been desperately searching for something similar since 2022. Well, THIS IS IT!!! I am a little heavier so I need that additional max cushioning or else my knees get sore. I have bought then returned the other running shoes that came out this year (ZoomX Invincible 3, Pegasus 41, Vomero",Zegama 1’s were my favorite trail shoe so I was excited when this update came out. The vibram sole is a major upgrade. Slipping on slick rocks and muddy surfaces doesn’t happen as much with the new vibram. They also changed the shoe tongue to a softer flexible material. It allows your ankle to flex more. This does change the way the shoe runs. I don’t mind it but it did take some breaking in.,Best trail shoe! Just wish they had darker colors because mine are stained from mud after a couple uses.,I was mesmerized by the design at first but somehow the coloring of the show came off after a week of purchase. Not used them much and the cushion is not the same anymore. Was wondering if only my zegema was defective but its past its return or exchange period tooA bit disappointed,"The Vibram outsole is the star of the update, but there are a couple of nice minor updates to the shoe including the heel cup which is more plush and secure than the previous version, and the plush tongue, which replaces the thin strip in the original Zegama. It feels more comfortable and well-built than the 1s (which are great). I was concerned about what I had seen about the narrowing of the toe","I had written off Nike trail a long time ago. This shoe has brought them back. Will be my 100 mile mountain race shoe. Midsole soft, finally vibram, toe box wide enough. Only two issues I hope they fix, add .5-1mm in lug depth or change the pattern. Could use a little more bite going uphill. Get rid of the eye lace reinforcement piece. Bulky and adds weight. Overall, a fantastic shoe for long runs in the mountains!!",I own a pair of the original Zegamas & Nike trail sent me & my wife both a pair of these and we wore them on out trip to dc and the DMV. After walking 10 plus miles around my wife commented that the zegamas are much more comfortable than her Brooks..So much so that for Father’s Day she bought us another set in all black The toe is a little narrower than the original’s I will say,"Beyond comparison. I’ve owned the original Zegama (2Pairs), placed 500 miles on each, very well informed about this shoe. The Zegama 2 addressed all my minor issues with the sole, toe box and to me the tongue. So plush and nice, the midsole is springy yet cushioning. Sure footed on slick surfaces as well. They also will get people’s attention, very cool looking upper, looks great with anything. Well done Nike!",I used these for the second half of UTS 100k after my feet were already battered by the rockier more technical first half. These shoes were dreamy for this. Super soft and just enough grip on the rockier sections. I wouldn't take them down steep scree fields or up scrambles just because of the stability and cushioning getting in the way. The stability isn't bad but as with any maximalist shoes,"As an avid trail runner, Nike was the last brand I thought I would end up using for my trail running shoes. Sometime ago, I found out I have a lisfranc injury that never healed properly, and it causes me great discomfort on longer runs. I tried all the major brands in trail running in search of the most comfortable shoe to help with my lisfranc injury pain. One day I came across the Nike Zegama 2",Definitely soft & comfortable w a nice bounce in step & heel,I like these shoes. Comfortable and stylish,"Very comfortable and stylish, can easily wear daily","Just finished a 104 mile trail race in this shoe. Rained 75% of the race, 33,000 feet of drop gain. I wore this shoe the entire time. Never lost footing even on the wet rocks that were cliffside, it’s a legit shoe. I finished with a guy who also had them on the entire race. I usually change shoes when it rains but I just changes socks maybe 5 or 6 time and I was fine. Nike crushed it on this shoe….10/10","Great shoe but a bit stingy in the material over the foot so making them a bit snug, need to be offered in a wide fit or just given a little bit more in this area.  All my other Nikes fit very well, just the Zegama causing this problem.  Otherwise a fantastic shoe, but I shall have to go back to Speedgoats because of this fit issue :(",Great choice for the walking and running,"This has everything I liked in the first version (ZoomX midsole for soft yet responsive ride), good lockdown on the upper, long enough lugs on the bottom) along with the new addition of Vibram on the outsole so it handles wet terrain just fine now. Such a game changer! The stack height is high, but seems like there are some stabilizers built in, which seems more stable than the last version on more technical terrain. Love this shoe","My husband is in love with these shoes. He says they are so comfortable that he wants to get them in different colorways now. The shoes do have a thick, but cushioned sole. I can look at the shoes while he’s walking & see the shock absorption. It looks like he’s walking on springs. He runs, walks, & has worn them to the gym a couple times. I’m so glad he doesn’t have to compromise comfort over style. These shoes are the perfect balance.","I have worn countless trail runners from Nike and many other brands. This is one of the most comfortable trail shoes ever made, period. The ZoomX foam and rocker profile are so cushy, the sole is grippy, the upper is light and breathable.","Everything that made the Zegama 1 great is gone. This new version feels/looks like a Pegasus Trail shoe. The toe box is tighter, the heel cup is more shallow and the traction footprint is more narrow at the forefoot making it less stable laterally. Compare 1 & 2 side to side and the differences are clear. Sad because I was so looking forward to this version. Guess I will be buying up all the version 1's I can because this is a big miss, imo.","I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Nike ZoomX Zegama Trail 2 running shoes, and they exceeded all my expectations. From navigating trails in local parks to tackling different terrains, these shoes deliver exceptional performance and comfort.One of the standout features of the Nike ZoomX Zegama Trail 2 shoes is their incredible comfort. The ZoomX cushioning technology provides a",Not rugged enough for their purpose. Don’t believe all of the paid for reviews…,I’m a big fan of switching up the workout routine. I mainly hit the pavement or treadmill 15-25 miles per week but had the chance to give these bad boys a try and shake things up a little bit and super excited I ventured outside of my comfort zone. The PNW offers a lot of different trails to tackle of all lengths and varying degrees of skill. I’m a newbie to the trail running scene so threw these,"I purchased the Nike ZoomX Zegama Trail 2 shoes to elevate my running to new heights as I tackle the trails around my neighborhood. Upon unboxing them, I couldn't help but notice the detail of stitching and the gaiter around the ankle to keep dirty, sticks, and small stones out of my feet while running. There were several colors to choose from, but I chose black to hide the scuff marks of the","Fit and FeelThese shoes have a great fit, true to size. From my experience, the great fit comes from the secure heel cup that prevented heel slippage while I ran. The heel has a neoprene collar that did an excellent job preventing rocks and pebbles from entering my shoe. The lacing was easy to pull and made my foot feel tight and secure. The tongue seems to be made of a thick soft","Elevate Your Trail Running Experience! 🌟Fit and Feel:The Nike ZoomX Zegama Trail 2s are a true game-changer when it comes to trail running footwear. The fit is exceptional, hugging your feet like a glove while providing ample support and stability on rough terrains. The feel is nothing short of luxurious - thanks to the innovative ZoomX cushioning that offers an incredibly responsive","These are the best shoes I ever had. I typically suffer from foot pain with shoes. I have heel pain a lot. I have tried everything. Different shoes, different brand of insoles etc.  But, these shoes feel like I’m walking on clouds. I haven’t had any problems with my feet since having them. They are very comfortable. You can walk/ run in them everyday or long distances. They are very versatile and can be used as everyday shoes.","Best road and trail runner in quite some time.  I’ve had several pairs of Pegasus trails and have a slighter wider foot - I run about 12-15 miles per week combo road and trail, mostly wet paths and mixed terrain.  Fit is great, wide toe base - elite level of comfort and stability and traction with the Vibram sole.  Of the Pegasus trails I always go back to my Goretex 3’s but these are slowly","Great for short runsThe Nike ZoomX Zegama Trail 2 shoes are comfortable for short distance runs or walks. The Vibram technology on the shoe was tested on various terrains, including a Peloton Tread and a trail run. I found them to be comfortable during my quick 5k runs, but I think going up one size could provide a bit more comfort, especially for those with wider feet. The cushioning",The Nike ZoomX Zegama Trail 2 is a great addition to your trail running shoe collection. The ZoomX foam is amazing when it comes to the cushioning and responses well with each step. The traction on these is a monster! Never worry if you will not have enough traction on these because the zoomx zegama trail 2 will give you the perfect traction you need to take on any terrain with ease. The shoe is,"At first glance I wasn't sure how I was going to like these. They looked really heavy and bulky. I couldn't have been further from the truth. This shoe is extremely lightweight and fit great. I get amazing ankle support, added inches from the outsole, and a sleek design. If you're on the fence about buying these I can assure you you won't regret it. Nike has once again knocked it out of the park.","These shoes are great. Started out a bit snug and rubbed in the heel. But after a few more wears, they have loosened in all the right spots. Now they are amazing. The black and white with the most minimal of yellow accents looks awesome. Really a great shoe.","The Nike ZoomX Zegama Trail 2 is a great trail running shoe which offers a soft and stable ride. The ZoomX midsole offers ample cushion, and the Vibram outsole provides great traction for any trail environment. I had no trouble on dirt or gravel trails with uneven rocks. The shoes are on the heavier side likely due to thick layer of foam, and as a result they drag a bit at times. They did run a",I recently started incorporating more trail running into my movement and exercise routine due to a bout of shin splints I kept getting during running on harder surfaces (ie. pavement and treadmill). My previous running shoes were not suitable for more diverse terrain so these sneakers have become a very much needed part of my exercise wardrobe. The cushion and support in them make it feel as,"The ZoomX Zegama Trail 2 is the trail shoe you’ve been looking for!   My initial impression with this shoe was already positive because of the inclusion of the ZoomX technology (some of the best running tech on the market). Upon further inspection I found the soles to be outfitted with Vibram technology, for some added grip and traction for whichever treacherous trails you decide to embark","The ZoomX Zegama Trail 2 is the type of hiking footwear I’ve been anticipating from Nike.  This model feels like a complete upgrade from the previous with the most notable being the new Vibram outsole.  Starting from the top, the shoes upper is encapsulated with Nike’s engineered mesh giving just enough lockdown while staying extremely flexible giving this show practically zero break in time.  The","As someone who rarely strays away from the Nike Air Max/Jordan collections, these ZoomX Trail shoes were a shocker for me! They are super comfortable, and offer more cushion than my usual Air Maxes, which was surprising. Even though these shoes are marketed for trails, I would definitely recommend them for people who dont go on trails or hiking. These are great for the gym, everyday walking, and","For some context, I am a male in my mid 20s and I run about 60 miles a week. I am currently training for a 25km race and I primarily used the Zegama 2s for my easy and steady runs. I was quite impressed with the Zegama 2. One notable enhancement is the incorporation of Vibram technology into the outsole, providing excellent grip and stability, particularly on trails. This feature proved","As my first experience with a trail shoe, I was pleasantly surprised by how supportive but light these are. In a pinch I think these could work on the road too. As an added benefit that look great and they're not overly bulky like some trail shoes. I could imagine using these even as a daily wearer.","Overall great fit. Talk about comfort and quality. Very light weight. Secure fit around your ankle. Fabric expands has a soft touch. Love the small touches on the tongue saying all day, all night.","As an avid trail runner constantly seeking the perfect blend of performance, comfort, and durability, I was thrilled to get my hands (or should I say, feet) on the Nike ZoomX Zegama Trail 2.

I wore them every single day and most evenings as I went on my excusions.  I did over 10,000 steps everyday and not once can I say that my feet hurt.

I'm on my feet ALOT at work and they feel like I'm walking on a cloud. I love the design of the shoe and the many colors they come in!!! I normally wear a 7.5 in Nikes but since they run a little big I got them in a size 7.NIKE DO NOT STOP MAKING THESE AND DO NOT CHANGE THE DESIGN!!,"These are very comfortable walking shoes. I was not sure how well they would work for me, as Nike shoes tend to be a bit too narrow for my feet, but these were highly recommended so took a chance and ordered online. I tend to be between a 6 and a 6.5, ordered the 6.5 and it fits very well.",My wife loves this shoe! She bought it and worked out in it and came back all smiles! The cushion was perfect for the balls of her feet and the cylindrical design of the sole made the push and rock motion super easy…,My favorite work shoe. I’m standing for 9+ hrs a day and these are holding up very well. They are so comfortable. I am normally a size 5 but these fit more comfortably in a size 6.,The most comfortable and good looking shoes ever,"Very comfortable. Fits extremely true to size + wide, no need to size up as you may have to do with most running shoes, especially if you intend to use insoles. I sized up as I did with the wildhorse and experienced significant heel slippage, even with insoles. I returned and sized down 1/2 a size.","Ordered these at the end of June for work, where I am on my feet walking around for 40+ hrs/wk on concrete and walk an average of about 8-10 miles per day. They were super comfortable and I never had any foot pain, however by September I had completely worn through the bottoms of them. At this price point, I had hoped they would last me much longer, but I would order them again if I needed a pair of casual walking shoes.","These shoes are super comfortable at first try on and I love the rocker sole, very bouncy. I have a medium to wide foot and the toe box fit perfectly. The only thing is that they were a bit too short. I wear a women's 8 in regular shoes and usually an 8.5 in running / walking shoes and I have to exchange these for a 9.",I love this shoe! They feel great they look great. My walking pace increased with these shoes. Nike please drop more colorways in size 14 or drop the Motiva 2.,One of the best comfortable shoes I have ever worn.

I'm usually an 8 but went to a size 8.5 and they are perfect 👌,"I work as a RN in the Emergency Department, 6”1 and 260lbs and these shoes are golden for my 12hrs shift!","The Motivas are great for my walking regimen. The big, thick soles make me feel like I'm walking on air instead of concrete and they propel me foward so that I complete my walk in about half the time. This also allows me to walk further.As to comfort, I don't know if I'd walk around in these all day, but for my walks - 2.5 to 4 miles - they are great.The reason I'm abandoning my","These are the most comfortable shoes I own, I highly recommend them.","These shoes surprised me honestly. I usually wear running shoes or hiking shoes for long walks, but the extra cushion and rocker sole shape make these the best I’ve ever worn for walks exceeding a couple miles.","I’ve had these shoes during my military training and I can attest that these are the most plush, most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. Not even HOKAs can match this level of plushiness. Truly one of my best investments, since I felt I could run for miles upon miles with these things. If only I could have gotten the hot pink ones, because I bought the white/light purple ones; it’s a shame","I have 2 pairs of these, I am on my feet all day on hard concrete. If I wear any other pair of sneakers to work my legs ache, my feet hurt and I'm miserable. Took a chance bought a pair on sale then got extra 25% and paid $58 , I wish I had bought 2 pair. I get off my legs don't hurt and I don't feel so exhausted. I highly recommend if your on your feet all day these are the ones. Thank you Nike!!","I am a 60 year old, and these shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. These shoes bounce you up with every step!  You can walk forever in these shoes!  They actually bounce you to your next step. I am walking faster and no foot pain at all!  Love Nike❤️",Definitely different.  There is good arch support.  I like the look of them too.,"Very comfortable, very well cushioned. I wear these to walk several miles each day and I'm very happy with the feel. Good price and good look. I wear a 7 1/2 shoe and I ordered the 7 1/2. I might have been able to go up half a size, but I'm satisfied with the 7 1/2.","Amazing walking shoe! Best I’ve ever used, perfect for walking on city streets with all day comfort.",Best Walking Shoe Ever. I enjoy walking inside and out. These shoes are perfect and extremely comfortable. Don't wait they are worth it. You will not regret it.,"This is one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I'm a registered nurse and work 12 hour shifts. The hallways are long and my feet take a beating. I worn these to work and my feet did not hurt when I got home, but this shoe is not stylish or cute. Your foot sort of spreads out and the shoe looks huge.",Best walking shoes out there. I have a pair in almost every color! These are great if you are dealing with Plantar fasciitis or on your feet all day.  Buy you a pair or 5 NOW!!!!,"These shoes are the best, I have the black and tge white ones now. I’ve had two ankle surgeries in the past year and these shoes make walking so much easier and painless.","Super comfortable. Nice fit, just snug at the heel with good toe room.",I’m an ICU nurse and these are perfect for being on your feet. The traction is excellent too on slippery surfaces. They fit my custom orthotics perfectly. I highly recommend. (I size up by half a size for Nike as compared to other shoe brands.),"I’m a nurse that walks 10000+ steps on concrete floors every shift and these shoes absorb every one of those steps! My last 2 pairs were Hokas and I loved the shock absorbing soles but both pairs had issues   (Hoka customer service replaced them with no issues), so I  wasn’t sold on the durability. Nike always fit my feet perfectly, so when I saw the Motivas, I pounced. I have been so happy with",Probably one of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. I highly recommend.,"Feels like walking on the clouds, I recently have been recovering from achilles rupture and these have helped take the pressure off so much. Love the rocking motion, nice and spongey. Nice wide toe box and easy slip on/off too.","I walk 3+ miles a day for exercise and was having quite a lot of hip pain after a few months. I researched which shoes were recommended for walking specifically and saw these come up multiple times, so I gave them a shot. I am so happy I did! My hip pain has almost vanished after only using them for a couple weeks, and I feel so much better! I would recommend these to anyone who walks for fun or","Looks really great, design-wise, fits very different. This show runs reeeally small, I had already ordered half a size bigger than my usual size as the reviews recommended this, was still way too small. Also this shoe is more for (very) narrow feet. Walking was very awkward, I felt like walking in those wood sandals, was not a smooth rolling of the sole. When you need to use orthopedic",Great comfortable shoe and I highly recommend them also purchased some for my wife and she also loved them,My only complaint is that they’re not slip resistant.,"Just got them as a birthday gift and so far so good. They are super comfortable, have a great arch support and it does feel like you are walking on a cloud. Thank you Nike for coming out with a good walking sneaker.","I walk around 10 miles a day for my job, three days a week. After a year, I finally need a new pair. Incredible comfort. Can’t imagine walking in anything else.","Discontinued blue ones. Not everyone likes white or red shoes. Some ppl enjoy the baby blue but I guess I didn't buy it fast enough. I bought the black ones, love them came for another but the color choices could be better :( still giving 5 stars for comfort. I should take out 2 stars for color. Once u feel these pillows under ur feet, u will never look at ur other uncomfy shoes again. I wish I had these pregnant.",Very comfy and supportive for walking. I went up half a size after reading reviews and would recommend this. Would love to see them in all black with a black sole too!,"Im usually hesitant to rave about a shoe. I have flat feet and when on my feet for a long duration they tent to cramp and hurt. I go these shoes on vacation in NYC. I wore these throughout the city.  They feel as if you’re on a rocking cloud. I love these shoes, so much I got a second pair.","These shoes are brilliant. They have super soft and springy soles, which make them really comfortable. I wasn't sure if the shape would work on a pebbly beach but they seem to work well for all of my walk.",The BEST shoes I have ever bought!  Like walking on a cloud!  I wish I could buy more!,"These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I’m a server in a busy restaurant, and even after 12 hours on my feet I can’t feel the effects at all. They’re very cushioned and bouncy, and it’s like walking on air. I highly recommend for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet.",Purchased these shoes for a New York trip… I was instantly surprised how comfortable these felt from the moment I put them on! Great shoe for vacation when there’s a lot of walking involved…,"Overall shoes are great, look an fit wise. I do think there needs to be more cushion under the toe area. Walking while putting your heal down first an rolling the shoe tords your toes has a great feeling on my knees now that im in my late 40's. But my stride ends with pushing off of my toes, so a little more cushion would have been nice.",Very comfortable and I get a lot of compliments. Perfect work shoes for my long shifts. They are a little loud when walking ( due to the cushioning). But 10/10. I want to buy a 2nd pair in a different color.,"Soft wide toe box, awesome curve to the sole the help you take a step forward, cloud like cushion. Great for flat hard floors, would probably avoid for hills.  The shoe is so good I bought back up pairs and hope they release more colors!

I got half a size bigger than usual as my toe rubbed with a size 6.Very bouncy feel in these trainers.,"Wow, these are so good I plan to buy a few more pairs. Extremely comfortable and no issues with durability so far. I'm not a huge runner but I didn't have any issuing running in them either. I've purchased many Nike shoes over the years and I think these are my favourite.",This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. Perfect appearance and good feeling.,"Nike PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE KEEP THIS SHOE. This is by far my all time favorite walking and light jogging shoe of all time. My feet feel like walking on a marshmallow/ cloud and I love the rocker on this that propels you forward. I can walk longer and I have absolutely no pain in my knees, joints or feet afterwards. I wear Pegasus 38’s and 40’s which are good for runs but these Motivas just",Love these shoes! They feel so soft.,"I love these shoes! Better than my other sneakers that started with an H. So comfy.

This shoe is made perfectly for my feet.,Nice quality nice for every day use,Very comfy walking shoes. I really like how they rock your foot forward. I did go up 1/2 a size from my usual size in these and got the size I purchase for metcons and air maxes.,Really comfortable trainers and look good. A bit tighter across the toes than my Pegasus but not too tight.,These walking shoes are so comfortable this picture does not do justice the ordering process was easy the delivery was really fast I walk for hour and my feet did not hurt at all I will be purchasing another pair,A very comfortable shoe. Very impressed,Very comfortable and suitable for a walk jog session.,"I’m pregnant and needed some new walking shoes for my aching feet. Let me tell you, these do not disappoint! Very comfortable and bouncy. I have arched feet, so they give me good support.","I want to preface this by saying that I usually do not write reviews unless someone asks. I am writing this review because this is my all-time favorite shoe and I buy a lot of shoes. I own the Motiva and the Nike Invincible 3. I love them both. They feel similar, like walking on a cloud or a marshmallow. I use this shoe for walking mostly. I average 10,000 steps per day. I used them in Tokyo for 4",This is a nice shoe for walking. Wish I had brought sooner. Great shoes for the price. Definitely buying another pair in a different color,I love the shoes and would love to have them all black!,"So comfy. Fit true to my Nike size 10 as ever. I have previously used running trainers for my walking (just pavements / paths to get my steps in!), but these are superior. The emphasis is the rocker and cushioned heel makes it like walking on cloud - and they don’t have the same support / restriction that running trainers do. So this makes them more comfortable and breathable. Not sure how they’d hold up off-road, as they are great looking too!",Oh yes!!!!! Need it in all black instead of black and white please.,"Why three stars this is a good shoe, but is nowhere as soft as the INVINCIBLE RUN 3 The INVINCIBLE RUN 3 I still the softer more cushioned shoe. The INVINCIBLE RUN 3 is more stable and they don’t have the rocker effect like Nike Motiva. Why am I posting this review as I called customer service there was a lot of debate. No one was able to answer this question so I thought I’d add this onto","I love these shoes so much!! I have been using them for walking on my peloton tread. First, a while back I had stopped wearing Nike on the tread because they hurt my knees so bad. I switched to another brand and it was like night and day. So when I bought these shoes I did it because I thought they were cute and figured I’d wear them in a fashionable way. When I first put them on I was shocked!!","I’m a lifelong Nike brand user. So happy they have finally given us a true “walking” shoe. I am a power walker and absolutely love these shoes. Very comfortable right out of the box. Color choices are also very pleasing. Nike nailed it with these shoes. Just fyi, I wear a 9 in street shoes but always wear a 10 in Nike.  Thank you! 😊","I purchased these ahead of a city trip which would involve a lot of walking. As a sufferer of plantar fasciitis I needed something that would cushion my heel and these worked a treat! They are lightweight and have a lovely thick sole that made it comfortable to walk on.Based on other reviews, I did buy 1 size bigger - I'd recommend this too!","Like walking on a cloud! Very comfortable, I love the color as well! Received a lot of compliments!",I have many size 9 Nike shoes and being a lazy shoe lace tier I wiggle my foot into loosely tied shoes but with this pair is tied and untied every wearing so even though this is still quality Nike product it will be sparsely worn.The fitting is a little too tight compare with my previous shoes.If your a lazy wearer and product returner like me then I suggest order a 1/2 size larger than your usual size for a more satisfying and comfortable fitting.,Super comfortable!

Can you kindly offer wide in the future.,Nike Motiva is fabulous. Its comfy and stylish. Product was delivered earlier than expected. Very impressed,"Love, love, love these!  I bought these specifically for walking and they are so comfortable. They are so comfortable. I normally wear a 7.5 but they didn’t have my size so I ordered the 8 and they fit great!","I found this shoe to be unlike any shoe I’ve ever worn. As a person with balance issues, the Motiva took some getting used to because of the “slight rocking motion” I felt when I first started wearing them. In time I became used to them not being very flat and found them to be extremely comfortable during my 13 hour work days as a daycare owner. Jumping, running and the occasional climbing kept my","Had to get a half size up but great shoes. Perfect for long walks, not sure I’d run in them."

Could do with a size inbetween like they use to, so just a wide fitting instead of extra wide would have been ideal. Hey ho will keep on looking",Wide width and new materials feels great. Terrible color ways as usual for wides.,"Extra wide should become the standard, since in recent years the normal size has become tight as a torture implement, even if you upsize. I tried these extra wide shoes and they're the most comfortable I've had in ages!  Unfortunately they make me look like I'm 30 years older than I am; the style is what you'd expect retired mall walkers to wear. None of the cool styles (or colors) come in extra wide. It's a crying shame",Nike don’t make these like they used to! I’ll tell you what 99% of Nike should be Refunded because they’re not Extra Wide like they should be.

My only concern is the sole. The sole seems identical to the Pegasus 40. I went through the heels of the Pegasus 40 in under 200 miles so I had to switch shoes.

나이키 인피니티 런 4,"일단 사이즈부터 이야기하겠다. 내가 보통 나이키 295, 나이키 농구화 300, 아식스 290, 아식스 290 2E, 아식스 285 4E를 신는다. 인피니티 런 4 박스에 [295 4E]라고 대문짝만하게 박혀 있지만, 내 정확한 체감 사이즈는 아식스 285 4E와 동일하다. 만약 290 4E 시켰으면 작아서 반품할 뻔했다. 내가 아치가 몸 안쪽으로 무너지는 X다리 내전인데, 이 제품은 완벽하게 내전 잡아준다. 놀랍다. 괜히 쫄아서 스트럭쳐 살 필요 없다. 인피니티 런 1 이후 오랜만에 4를 샀는데, 쿠션 또한 1보다 훨씬 말랑말랑한게 확연히 체감된다. 다만 힐드랍 10mm가 느껴질 만큼 운동시 앞으로 쏠림이 느껴지지만 정작 앞꿈치쪽 쿠션이 고급 운동화에 비하면 아쉽다. 세일해서 12~3만원쯤에 한 켤레 건지면 일상화던 조깅용이던 무조건 추천할 만 하다. 내전인 사람은 스트럭쳐 말고 이거 사라. 다만 사이즈는 원래 사이즈보다 무조건 1업을 할 것...",와이드라서 잘 맞을줄 알았는데일반 신발대비 길이가 짧아요275신으신다면 280으로 가셔야될듯...,"발볼 넓고, 완전 편하고, 적정하고 쫀득한 쿠셔닝에,, 진짜 인생 최고의 러닝화인듯. 강추합니다. 4e라, 정사이즈 가시면 됩니다.",윤튜브에서 극찬하는 이유를 알수 있다안정감이 추가된 단단한 인빈서블1 같은 느낌단 엑스트라 와이드임에도 불구하고 반업에 이정도면 정사이즈는 착용이 불가능한 신발임과체중 미드풋 포어풋 주법엔 비추접지 좋고 역대 인피니티 중 신고 벗는게 가장 편함단 발등 높은 사람은 반업도 힘듬,All around comfortable shoe. I got them to have something with extra cushion on the heels. I got my true size and it seems fine so I guess sizing up is not for everyone. Biggest dislike for me about the shoe is that the tongue is sown down. I feel it makes it a little too snug on the top of the foot. I cut the straps on the sides that are holding the tongue down and it was perfect after that. Haha.,I liked the shoe as soon as I put it on. I needed the extra wide option. Stylish and comfortable.,"Finally a wide sizing for the infinity series. It’s still not true to size for me, i sized half a size up.The only improvement is to make an all black version in extra wide as these shoes are very popular in the professional space due to it’s comfort.","These are good for wide feet, but dont forget to go up a half size. The invincible run 3 and pegasus fit me well in size 9 wide, but these are snug so i shouldve gotten a 9.5. Also, the lace where the knot is seems to bite into my foot in a way that doesnt happen with any other shoe i have. Not painful, just noticeable enough to be slightly annoying.","Bought these on a whim and glad I did. Saucony, NB, and Brooks fail to deliver wide shoes but these are a great fit. The cushioning is very nice and also helps with knee pain I get occassionally. More colors would be a nice touch. I was going to order custom pair but there was no wide sizing for them which knocks these to 4⭐️. I often feel these reviews go unnoticed and don’t offer what wearers request.",Nice shoes. Lots of cushioning and comfortable. Need additional colors like blue or brown for wide sizes.,I can finally stop buying New Balance! I have had to buy NB for years because of my super wide feet. These are just as comfy and look a million times better!,"Comfortable shoe, just wish the tongue was not sown down.",Comfortable and soft but fit run 1/2 size smaller. I have to return a pair and sized up.,Very comfortable especially for diabetics with feet problems. Strongly recommend,These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever bought from Nike. They are a perfect width for my flat feet (no arch at all). They look good. They feel good—nice plush insides. I only rated the shoe 4 out of 5 because the insoles started to move inside the shoe. Maybe it's because I have sweaty feet. I wear stance socks so they absorb moisture. But the insoles constantly move when I'm,"I’m onto my 6th pair of Infinity’s (including the older models). They’re consistently comfortable. Ideal for a neutral runner, but  brilliant for those in need of stability. So much cushion for long runs. Thats generic across all models. The 4th edition carries on with this. The only complaint is the extra weight and thicker upper means they’re warmer and slower. They also run a half size small,",the most comfortable Nike shoes I have ever owned.. great cushion all around the shoes look big or wide but really comfortable..felt tight in the beginning but got way better after few weeks.,"These are my favorite running shoes so far. I liked that this shoe offered the wide version and I believe the only other shoe that offered a wide option was the pegasus 40, but the pegasus didn't give me that cushion I was looking for and felt really flat. A lot of the other Nike running shoes are really tight and snug even after sizing up half a size.",Great shoe very comfortable also didn’t notice to go half size up so my 10.5 which i am in all my Nike shoes but this one is very snug. Having a small issue if i was getting lace bite. Other than that shoes are amazing running and walking.,"Nice daily trainer. Bought the extra wide, which is listed as wide. Not sure why there is a discrepancy. I did not see the note on the product stating that you should size up. This is a half size smaller than the Pegasus in both length and width. Smooth cushiony ride that allows you to pick up the pace a little bit, but not something I would do an interval or tempo session in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 50k was mostly on logging roads covered in wet leaves and these shoes really did amazing.  I am now mostly running on roads with the zoom fly 6s, but if I am doing any trail running coming up would much rather run on these vs other trail runners I have tried",This shoes gives a bulkier look than expected. Make no mistake!! Everything about this shoe is phenomenal but I will be returning it because it doesn’t fit my style is all. I wish they came with more colors but the show itself is amazing. I learned that it is more hiking and camp trail type of shoe and it has a light but SOLID traction that you would feel even stick to flat surfaces. 10/10 on,"Hi I've had quite a few shoes from Nike and all been good , these shoes fitted well good reviews but the colour ! Trail shoes are surely designed for running in dirtier conditions, I can't understand why so bright they would be filthy after one parkrun and would be difficult to clean , need to be darker colours in my opinion.  😊","Awesome! Rad cool colors and patterns, feels great just standing around or after a full day of working out! The price may seem steep, but if you need a kick-butt running shoe that’s got it all, the “Ferrari” of kicks so to speak, then this pair is for you! Bold style w/ extra cushioning from toes to heel and plenty of grip to chew up the blacktop as you pass by all your friends. Nike men’s victory for a reason.  Go for the neon pink, give the walkers something to stare at as you fly by…",I used the Nike Ultrafly Trail Racing shoes in hiking and trekking going up to Everest Base Camp and Mount Ararat in Turkey and it’s really really becoming my new friend on the mountains.,I got these for my husband who’s a fan of “ The Yellow Runner” for his first 100k.He said it’s the best shoe he’s ever owned!,"Fast & fun shoe to run in on the trails ,good roomy toebox , true to size","At best I would use this on gravel paths and road, nothing steep or technical. ZoomX is super nice foam, the Vibram sole is great. Limited use case shoe, but does long non technical gravel roads very well.",Feels like luxury hiking shoes… great stability…worth the money…love wearing everday.  Please make more colors.,"I love this shoe! I'm able to run longer distances while retaining the same comfort as the start. It's fast, durable, has sticky grip and has a nice wide toe box. Please make another colorway so I can buy a second pair to rotate.","Exceptional grip, a responsive midsole, and great cushioning make this my favorite Nike trail shoe. While it isn't great for super technical or sloppy/muddy terrain (lugs aren't quite deep enough), it can handle the majority of trails well and you can't beat the combination of cushion and pop for once you are ready to pick up the pace! The Vibram outsole is a game changer for Nike trail",These probably have to be one of the most comfortable trainers on the market that can also be worn as daily recovery/walking trainers too. The forefoot strike up hills/trail as others have mentioned feels a little stiff but not that this bothered me that much. Only gave 4 star as a couple of things that could be improved. 1. A little on the heavy side 2. The color/style of this trainer for a trail,Goes up and down trails like being strapped into an elliptical machine on auto.,"Fast shoe, better suited on tight compact trail or any other hard surface. Grippy sole, vibram thank you, wouldn’t recommend in muddy conditions. Drained well with a wide forefoot that made for a very comfortable ride.","Foam and midsole are top notch - my favorite foam density/thickness of any Nike shoe. However it’s advertised trail abilities are sub par, on road it’s my go to shoe!",Fantastic trail shoe Nike zoom x is brilliant,"Echoing others’ sentiments - these have a pretty limited use case. They’re probably great for packed trails, semi-paved, gravel, and dirt, but there’s simply not enough ankle support for technical courses.They’re otherwise a great, fast, shoe, but they’re ankle killers on technical terrain","I bought these at the expo at UTMB and took them from box to race. And they were fantastic. No blisters, no feet problems. The wide toebox is fantastic, the foam soft, and the plate isn't too harsh. The eva casing got beat up a bit, but the shoes performed admirably. Unsure how many miles they'll be able to handle before bottoming out, but they instantly vaulted to my favorite trail shoe in my lineup","I purchased these for my 15yo son to use for cross country races. We live in AZ, many of his xc races are partially on gravel and pavement. That makes running in xc spikes a really bad idea.  These are PERFECT for the the courses he will be on this year. He's had one race in them so far and they preformed exceptionally well on multiple surfaces.  Concrete paths, muddy grass, packed dirt and tiny gravel.","Let me start out by saying that I’m a Nike Running Product Tester. But, Nike did not send me these shoes. I purchased them. I laced my Ultrafly’s up this morning for a 12 miler fresh out of the box. These shoes are ineffable and leave me speechless. They have the right amount of cushioning and plate isn’t as aggressive as the Vaporfly and Alpha. The wide forefoot will allow you to toe off",These shoes are incredible! They are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn that zoomx foam really lives up to the hype. They are also extremely light and they look big but once u put them on they feel like you’re wearing a sock. This shoe has amazed me in everything grooms looks to comfort and quality. The only thing I will say is they run big and even bigger because of the toe box,"One run of 10.5 miles on a fairly easy trail on these, and I am very happy how they perform out of the box.  These shoes handled the loose rock and tree roots on the terrain pretty easy.  The sole seems to be sticky and grip was very good.   I also run in the Zegama, which is a comparable shoe, just without the plate.  Happy with this purchase.","I could not wait to try these out as my road shoes are nikes, now nike have collaborated with vibram and the carbon technology that are in these should be a win win all round nike have actual thought about a trail shoe, i hope they bring out a better colour than white first run out they got covered and are made out of material that is not that eaay to wipe clean?The size of the shoe are bigger","I've logged about 30 miles in these with three VERY different runs: a half-marathon race on mixed trail and asphalt, an easy daily training run on semi-technical trail and a tempo workout on forest service road. My suspicions were confirmed that the use case for these shoes is EXTREMELY limited, but it's certainly not a dealbreaker. It's no secret that Nike's outsoles have left a lot to be","I was looking forward to these dropping, first impressions out of the box were really promising, first try on and equally as good, they have a large toe area which suits my feet perfectly, I struggled slightly getting the fit to secure my ankle, eventually I was ready to go for a run, I decided to go for a 10k mainly canal/trail loop with a few bursts to test them out. They felt OK but something",Very comfortable ! I have wide feet these are a great fit ! I love the upper and the vaporfly like tongue.  You get a nice ride along the trails and the grip is fantastic. I could happily wear these for all of my runs ! I love those colourway but realistically they will look terrible after a few runs. Hopefully we get some nice bright colour ways soon,"Fits true to size, comfortable out the box, flexible upper , sole very stiff, these “trail” shoes are for gravel paths,hard mud, road etc not for muddy trails , never experienced nothing like these they are so fast it’s cheating really, carbon plate pushes you on your forefoot and you just spring forward effortlessly!!! I would guess Vaporfly trail equivalent, lot of pbs will be broke with these","These are my favourite looking trainer since the OG Vaporfly! So cool and so so comfy! I’m gonna have to get 2 pairs, one for casual and one for running 😅😅","Having flat feet, I often struggle to find running shoes that provide adequate heel support. However, the moment I slipped these shoes on and took my first few steps, it was like walking on clouds. Each step felt cushioned and springy. At first, the fabric of the shoes felt a little bit tight, but adjusting the laces made them more comfortable. The shoes are made out of a breathable and","I have worn dozens of different kinds of shoes, but none of them compare to these! The fit was perfect. I have personally had trouble finding shoes that fit just right. These were immediately comfortable right out of the box. They felt springy in a way that motivated me to get out onto the trail and start walking.  I walked the trails for miles without a hitch thanks to these shoes. The design of","When these shoes came out of the box, I was a little dubious. These are not your average running shoes--especially the space-age plastic-y feeling material that they're made out  of.I gave them a try, though, both on the trail and at the gym. And I gotta say...I'm a believer.These shoes are incredible. The material is light and breathable so my feet don't overheat, but the sole is","The shoes are really comfortable and softer than other tennis shoes. My feet are wider than normal so I have to loosen the laces a bit more than other shoes. The shoes are designed for hiking, but I have loved shooting hoops in my driveway with these. Design is okay — a style I wouldn’t normally buy but I do like them. If I could change one thing then it would be for a little give in the width.",These shoes fit so well. I took them out for a test run the day I received them and I love how comfortable they were. It almost feels like I don’t have any shoes on at all. I am also in love with the color. It’s just a splash of color on them. They are truly my favorite running shoes.,"All running shoes are a compromise; usually a balance between lightness, support, durability and stability. Most trail running shoes in my experience are on the heavier side of the scale emphasizing stability most of all which leads to chunky designs. These ultrafly shoes though, are something special. These are the first trail shoes that feel just as light and nimble as on road runners, yet have",This is the one. It is simply the best trail shoe for those easy trail runs where you need good cushioning and a carbon plate to go faster when you need to. The Pegasus and Zegama shoes were too bulky for me on trail runs and this is the perfect mix of a regular Pegasus with zoomx to really make you go fast!,After many hours of hiking/ walking the trails this shoes holds up pretty nicely. The inner sole is so comfortable it actually feels like your hiking on clouds. The flyknit makes the shoe lighter so your feet do not get tired from lugging around extra weight. The extra thick sole adds an extra layer of protection to handle the messiest of terrains. With all the great features the shoe has there is,"Wow, this is the one! Can’t beat this super comfortable ZoomX trail running shoe. The carbon plate and almost textile wrapped foam keep if from feeling to cushy on foot too. AND a vibram outsole!! A great touch, super grippy, and super durable. I tend to shy away from white for my trail runner but this color scheme is classic Nike. Looks good clean and even better with a little dirt on it! The Nike ZoomX Ultrafly Trail for the win","I would first like to say I am a fan of the images on the Nike trail box. Most shoes come in plain jain boxes but I was quite amazed with detailed graphics surrounding the outer side of the shoe box. The shoe itself is EXTREMELY comfortable I must say. Whether walking, jogging, or running you would not be disappointed with comfortability or durability of the shoe. I was impressed with the stylish","Have always been an avid road runner, however these are my first pair of trail shoes. The zoom ultrafly have that bounce to keep you going. Functionally, the sneaker exceeds expectations - only complaint is I’m not wild about the tongue. Doesn’t feel as secure as other Nike’s","I LOVE these shoes, probably my favorite trail-running shoes to date! They are super light and feel very agile with the Nike spring that I’ve gotten use to in road-running shoes, but very supportive and stable for trails with great grip. Basically perfect! I’ve put a lot of miles on them, running mostly on dry rock/gravel trails with some water (but no mud), and it makes a run that includes road","The Nike ZoomX Ultrafly Trail shoe has changed the outdoor running game for me. The carbon fiber plate helps to propel me forward with each stride. It’s cushioned sole is unlike anything I’ve tried on, and the best part is, it is still very lightweight (thanks to the Vaporweave mesh!). I’ve worn these shoes to run on grass, concrete, crushed limestone, and dirt, and regardless of the ground type",I needed a new pair of shoes for just everyday wear and working around my yard.  I figured that going with a trail shoe would give me some better traction when I'm outside working in the yard or playing with my god was I right.  I'm so glad I just trusted my gut and went for it.  The extra traction on the trail sole give me that little footing insurance when it's early in the morning and still wet,"This shoe caught me by surprise when I first took a step. Very comfortable, felt like your foot is insulated in a cloud of foam. Each step felt more aligned, reducing certain pressure points increasing comfort. I’d recommend this shoes for anyone looking to improve active and reduce joint pain. Comfortable, fashionable and well fitted. The NIKE ZOOMX ULTRAFLY TRAIL is becoming one of favorite go to sneakers!","This shoe has made me want to hike regularly! The ZoomX technology provides a level of comfort that I wasn't expecting to find in a trail shoe. The shoe is wider up around the toe which is great for someone like me who has let their feet widen a bit over the years. Whether you're walking casually or amongst rocky terrain, this shoe is sure to fit nicely to your foot. I loved the lacing system","The Nike Zoomx Ultrafly Trail has been one of the most comfortable shoe I’ve used in a long time. I used these should runs, playing basketball, walks, and more. While this shoes offers a see through material that may not seem that durable, it has surprised me as to how durable it has been. That shoe has been stepped not multiple times during uses and it has not suffered much damaged. Through my","The ZOOMX ULTRAFLY TRAIL is extremely comfortable and supportive. You recognize the responsiveness in your first steps. After logging 30+ miles in the shoes, I’ve found my times are averaging about 7 seconds faster than in my previous pair of Nike Reacts. The toe box feels a bit wide, but after running a few times you begin to understand the shape a bit more. The only issue I’ve seen is",These shoes are amazing! I’ve never had trail running shoes but I’m hooked now. It feels like I’m running with tractor tires on my feet when I’m on dirt roads. Definitely would recommend if you do a lot of off-paved road running/walking,"If you have wide feet and love running trails, this is a shoe for you! I always struggle to find a shoe that will absorb impact from small rocks on the bottom of my foot while being stable, but this shoe does it perfectly. The bottom is made of some kind of foam that absorbs impacts, but at the same time feels really comfortable and solid. The top is made of plastic cloth, and my only worry is","My fiance loves these sneakers. We went on a hike/ run this past weekend and his feet have never felt better. They did run just a bit small , he usually wears a size 12 so when purchasing these keep that in mine. The color-way was just perfect for summer and his late night runs.  The comfort level on the Nike Zoomx Ultrafly Trails is outstanding. The shoes have an amazing cushion that absorbs impact and makes your daily run smoother than ever. Overall, I highly recommend these sneakers.","A very attractive shoe that upon first glance doesn’t strike you as a trail-runner. The  w i d e  toe box provides plenty of wiggle room for the toes, and the super soft foam provides a plush, almost numb, ride-feel.

Not even a close second. This is my favorite shoe of the year and one of the best shoes I've ever run in. They feel amazing at any pace: easy, endurance, tempo, etc. Now I just want to run every day in them, they ruined the rest of my shoes for me. I'm thinking this seriously could be my marathon shoe without having to break the bank for AlphaFly or VaporFly.","Giving 4 out of 5 due to having run 1x in them—takes a few to find any potential quirks usually. Pros: light, super cush—easy to remove /unglued insoles so orthotics fit easily into them. No Cons at this time. Bought for the extra cushion/knee protection from impact due to thick heel. Seems like a safe shoe for recovering from injuries or surgery. Enjoyed the first run in them.","I'm loving these shoes! Just gonna say they do run snug, I'm usually 9.5, if I could go back I'd get size 10. Also I love the fact that the tongue is NOT connected to the rest of the shoe like these modern runners, YOU CAN ACTUALLY WEAR THEM LOOSE! 12hr days in the hospital that really really helps! The ZoomX is boingy, and the plate makes every step feel like a spring. Hopefully these will be available in the ""design your own"" section so I can make a 'Greyed-Out' version.","Nike got it right this time compared to the previous model. I’m a big fan of the Zoom Fly 4, and after trying the latest version Zoom Fly 6, I definitely recommend these shoes. Comfortable, responsive, and flawless.","Had my first run in them and I was sold .25 miles in. I went 7.5 miles in them and here are my thoughts. These shoes improve upon everything the Zoom Fly 5 was trying to do. The upper is better, the heel lock is better, the traction is better, the rocker shape is better, the shoe is lighter, the ZoomX is so much softer, and even the little cutout on the sole’s mid-foot area is better. This shoe is lighter, less clunky, and softer than its predecessor. It lives up to all the hype and then some.",Really good support and cushion for those who are heavier. I had to go up half a size so if you can try them in store to get the right fit for you. Over all one of the most comfortable running shoes I own.,"Nike has successfully revitalized this shoe line, delivering a fast, rockered, and protective design. It's versatile enough for tempo runs, workouts, and daily running, making it a strong choice for runners. Great work from Nike!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
